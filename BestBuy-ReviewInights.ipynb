        "Perfect for our bedroom! Love how the plug doesn't protrude from the outlet, can fit it in between the bed and wall It works great with my Cannon EOS Rebel T3i and my short 55mm lens. It allows me to protect my camera when I go to a sporting event where my big bag is not allowed. It keeps my coffee warm for hours and I don't have to worry about it spilling with the lid having a good seal. I love this computer. It's very easy to setup and use. I just didn't realize that it didn't have a disk drive. It would have been helpful if the sales person would have told us that before we bought it. Texting is easy. Speaker phone does not echo. Screen does not scratch easily. Voice recorder understands me. Very easy to dial vocally. Great camera! Nice sound! I love it ! Nice slim line case cover. More like a midnight blue than navy - has a casual look. Does fancy up the backing - cute. Worth the price for fashion not for protection. I bought a few diff styles to change it up. Overall happy. It just a cable and it works. It may not be gold but for the human eye and ear is it really discernible. Great item but should be made of.metal just to give it that extra grip. Could Also Use A Rubber Lining On Side THST CONTACTS The pole/rollbar Enjoy watching YouTube on TV from my iPhone. Can't beat the price. Unfortunately limited when using smart phone. GRAPHICS ARE AMAZING, BUT ONE PROBLEM IS THE STORYLINE IN CAMPAIGN MODE. SEEMS LIKE JUST WHEN YOUR INTO THE ACTION, IT TAKES YOU RIGHT INTO THE STORYLINE YET AGAIN WHICH CAN BE LONG AND ANNOYING. FOR MULTIPLAYER ITS THE BEST RIGHT NOW!! you get a lot of k-cups for a low price...I love caramel! I think the tablet is good for price and it loaded with kids software , and some basic adult Amazing game graphics and picture are awesome I am picky but live this game it is a very good product............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ After several disappointing outcomes with another brand, we ordered an avanti. it is well lit, has a nice temperature dial WITH numbers., seems to be maintaining a constant temp. purchased the model with the molded top so things don't slide off easily. Great and solis metal piece, price is reasonable. Mount color solid black loved it I have downloaded this album and I have played it repeatively. The music shows Beyonce's versatility as an artist and a performer. The album also shows her happiness as a mother and as a wife. It shows her freaky side. this is a great movie. very funny, entertaining and family friendly. my kids love it. I got it so I could more easily carry around books with me. Price was great and features are easy to use. Love it. Great value. It's very easy to use. The screen is the right size. This was the right choice for our first tablet. good product for the price. there are still too many components to the filter that clog easily. Very good movie to watch, my whole family enjoyed this one. I would recommend this to anyone Good quality sturdy connector cable. We bought 3 cables for all the different electronic hook ups I thought it was cool from the first minute I laid eyes on it. It brings back some old childhood memories. Love the design and the construction of it. The screen cover still allows great response, even with a stylus. I love the NInja, this is my second NINJA product. Since my purchase I have made veggie smoothies, Ice cream smoothies and a myriad of natural fruit juice and oatmeal energy drinks, the NINJA products a products that I would recommend time and time again. I love it.... good product. we've just started using it and will be doing more. Good power backup so I don't have to worry about any brownouts shutting down my main gaming PC in the middle of whatever I'm doing. I loved that this was a daily deal and got it for a very nice price. After about 3 years, it was time to replace. Now it works great! I love that this case is flexible and allows the ipad to stand alone. I also like that it automatically puts the ipad to sleep when you close the case. Top top top top top top top top\n",
        "Top top top top top top top top High-quality product that is easy to install and easy to use; fun to play with and to share photos and videos with friends; quick downloads (most of the time); great content, but needs more free apps -- many apps cost money; plus, many of the same features can already be found on most smart TVs and video game consoles This unit was out of the box, plugged in and operational in less than 10 minutes. 100% functional with no problems or compatibility issues. The modem was immediately recognized by my cable company (Charter) and after providing a few pieces of information at their website, I was able to connect to the Web. This was a swap out of an older Surfboard Modem that had lasted 10+ years. Got this as a Deal of the Day at a great price, great value! Good batteries and a nice case to hold them, what more could you ask for? Recommended! Keurig - Coffee People Donut Shop the best.i had buy other coffe brand and i always go back to this one. Gave it to my 8 year old, and it goes everywhere he does. Had to replace the first one after he broke the screen (it was covered under the one year warranty). I asked him if he wanted something different and there was an enthusiastic NO! He loves this iPod and it goes everywhere with him. Excellent way to make virgin colodas. Love the was you can make it with low fizz or high We are very pleased with the quality and serviceability of the iPad Air cover. It will provide protection and multi position functionality. this is a great sound system very easy to set up , and it sounds great, very glad I bought it. I think this is a easy and fun tablet for the price. Looking at getting a keyboard down the road. It a great accessory for my tab to keep it protected. I bought these for my son. I was tired of buying cheap headphones for his computer. And having to replace them a month later. So I finally saw the light after about 5 terrible headphones. These sound amazing. They at 1st are very comfortable. But can get rough on your ears after a long time. So for the price on sale. That really wasn't a deal breaker. They are well made solid headphones. And my son likes the long cloth cord too. I bought this case at the same time I ordered my microsoft surface 64gb RT and was really pleased with the protection it provides my surface, for the price it can't be beat so I highly recommend this protective case Recommend highly I have an apply iPad also and each tablet has its good points but I like the nexus 7 the best I love it because I don't need my computer to watch Netflix shows anymore. Product was bought for toy hauler on vacation. Easy to install and set up. Light weight and easy to move. its easier to read books and take up less space the a actul book seems to have a picture as good as a samsung and was more affordable. the size is just perfect for the stand and the room. easy to understand and use remote. the salesperson was very helpful and was patient and understanding., went the extra mile to locate the set at another store for us. If you don't need something that sways out, this is a solid unit for the price. It does have release pins that allow you a little tilt for access to in and outputs. This is my first tablet and I didn't want ot invest a lot of money in something I don't know a lot about. Primarily use it for travel to avoid carrying a heavy laptop. Good for games as well. This was such a great game when it was originally released for the ps2, and unlike all things that are remastered, it only got better. Whether you're a Disney fan, a Final Fantasy fan, or just looking for a non-ultraviolent game, this has it all. Can't wait for 2.5 remix! Got this case on sale for $35, better quality than others online, fits perfectly and doesn't block IR blaster. Only issue I have is if I want to eject the SD card, I have to take the left half of the tablet out of the case backing. I bought this lenses cleaning pen with our new Sony camera, From what I can tell, It does what its supposed to do. This is the first pen style lenses cleaner that I have purchased. Having only used wipes till this point, I am a fan of the convenience. Love this cover the color and it is light weight also keeps my tablet clean since we bought a white one Must buy them!!! I bought theses for my nephew and he loves them... Love it. It's the perfect size. Fits in my purse and can go where I go. Easy to use, great apps. Bigger than my iphone but more mobile than the regular iPad. GREAT FOR BEGINNERS OR ADVANCED DJS. SOFTWARE IS EASY TO USE AND YOU CAN GET RIGHT TO RECORDING YOUR OWN MUSIC MIXES RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX. YOU ALSO GET A FREE MONTH MEMBERSHIP TO GROOVESHARK WHICH IS ALSO AWESOME IF YOURE AT A GIG AND NEED TO DOWNLOAD A REQUEST IMMEDIATELY. GREAT PRODUCT, AWESOME PRICE AND VERSATILITY. I bought this tablet primary for using on the go. Bought sim card at t mobile register it and get free 200 mb every month. i dont play game just check email surf net. love it! I bought this mainly for my 5 year old autistic son and he loves it so far. Its alot cheaper and better than most of the kids tablets for the price. Its holding together well after 2 months. Screen easily cleaned. Processing speed and downloads fast. I like my new iPhone 5s and I was super happy that it automatically transferred the contents of my iPhone 4s to the 5s; I love the talk to text feature.\n",

        "Unfortunately, it does not seem any better than the 4s. It is no faster or smoother. I'm new to this lens, but am just astounded with the precision and detail. I'm absolutely thrilled with it as both a macro and a portrait lens. We really like the taste of the Starbucks Breakfast Blend coffee the best. We've tried at least 15 brands and flavors in the K-cups. I would recommend this bag for ipad storage. It has a lot of compartments and is very durable. I had a very old router which did not seem to keep up with the computer and internet, switched out to this and everything is running great This machine performs like no other. If you are looking for a machine that gives you your monies worth, this is it! The coffee tasted very good, i would recommend it to anyone. These headphones are great. The fact that they are wireless makes them even better. As a young man, rather I like to admit it or not, the Beats by Dre brand is another added bonus. I'm ignorant when it comes to the terms for headphone quality and what not. All I know is I listen to all kinds of music, watch YouTube clips, and netflix movies all while wearing these headphones and they all sound great!! While the sound quality, the look of the headphones, and the feel of them while you're wearing them are great, the price is not. If the price of these headphones were $100 cheaper they would be on everybody's ears. Bug I guess you get what you pay for. Another added bonus is that the headphones have the ability to be wireless or wired and even comes with two wires, one with iControl capabilities and another black wire to go with the matte black finish of my headphones. Over all was a mess the console was delivered damaged with 4 pieces of wood damaged and one of the glass doors broken. had to alot of phone calls but they were replaced and it looks great It's perfect if you want to show off the silver or gold iphone while keeping it protected it's not a hard case and not like a soft soft case but the case is plastic so it can absorb a fall definitely This is a great product as I have long fingernails and it was hard for me to use my tablet love this I bought this bag, trying to get the features of a high end bag, without having to spend a lot of money, and I think I scored. I like the fact that you can swing the bag around to the front of your body and remove what you want. The only problem that I can see is the depth of the dividers. The keyboard has a great feel and well laid out. The mouse is comfortable and very responsive. GREAT PRODUCTS. My hubby bought me this for my birthday and we are still learning to use it but I would reccommend it to a friend....lots of fun we dont have to fight over computer time hope to get better at using it I have 2 of these cards and both of them are working great after 2 months used. I bought them on sale for about half off so it was a even better deal. But overall a very good card with no issues so far. I love this cell phone cover! It's absolutely beautiful and very fashionable. It goes with everything from jeans to the nicest dress in my closet! It's my favorite cell phone case/cover! I watched this movie with me son and it had me laughing. It had a good mix of adult and kid friendly humor. What my family and I like about this product was it included two games. It's hard to set up. However, it's fun to play with. Very basic cover but fits nicely. Can't even tell I have it on,, I didn't get it for the protection aspect of a cover. I got it more for protecting the back from scratching. Although I drop the phone once and doesn't not show any damage to either the case or my HTC one. ,, Good Modem. Using it for Cox connection since 1 month - no issues faced. I have tried lots of k-cup coffee. I usually load my own coffee into a cartridge because I can't find any that taste good. These hit the spot! Something easy for me to use and does the job well This case gives me a sense of security w/my phone. It is sturdy. Decent Router for use in 2 bedroom Apartment. No Issues faced till now - bought it a month ago Compatible with Verizon FiOS. \"N\" range.\n",

        "Third Floor Coverage is better, but still isn't 4 bars through some parts. Really wanted quality pictures without having to 1) buy a camera the size of a small dog and 2) learn every feature of photography. The auto features are really great and every feature/setting has an explanation. The camera even has tips for shooting. Thought when I was buying it, it could automatically download photos to wifi but this one can't. That is the II model which is a couple hundred more. U can buy wifi memory cards for 40/80 bucks so I'll just do that. Overall, highly recommend heading to the store and checking it out. Reviews drew me in, holding and shooting it sold me. Also, flash in daylight still awesome. Took portrait shot with sun in background. Faces lit up beautifully in broad Florida daylight. Great deal, love how much you can do with it. Lots of free applications that are very useful. Love that I can read wherever I am and don't have to wait for it to load. Cute movie, great for the kids and adults. Good plot and we love the minions. Agnes is so cute especially with the unicorn. Very effective and efficient...love how I can capture the moments of the little ones that don't like to be in front if the camera with this device Great picture quality and easy to connect to the internet. Very nice TV. This mat really helps keep my laptop cool and secure. This spray is so awesome it cleans everything. I use it for netflix cd's before I insert then into my cpu. I also use it to clean my mouse. Super silent device, USB 3.0 interfase, it`s a perfect mate for storage all you need I have 3 of them hooking up different devices. It helps with better picture quality. Having 3 doesn't get in the way of one another. Im sitting on the chair right now :) Was having some minor neck and back issues with my old chair but this chair helped. Solid design and easy set up. I got this chair on sale,Im not sure if I would have paid full price but overall its a good chair. I had it for a month already Short and sweet is that these are reasonably priced and sound OK. They aren't Beats but they didn't cost as much either. I got my Beats By Dre Studio wireless headphones for Christmas otherwise I probably wouldn't have justified spending that much on myself. But they are really worth it in the end. I wear them at work a lot and I embarrass myself frequently because I start dancing and forget that people can see me sometimes. The wireless part is wonderful. I can go anywhere in my house and the music is fine or 3 or 4 offices away at work before the music starts to get choppy. I listen to a lot of dance and club music and the sound quality is second to none. Of course, I've never spent almost $400 on headphones before. Overall, it's a great product and I'm extremely happy I got them. Has three speed and quiet operation. easy to install. color is bright and noticable. Nice amount of storage, faster interface (RJ45), nice new desing The Nintendo 3DS XL (in black) is a new favorite in our house.\n",
        "My oldest daughter received it for Christmas and hasn't put it down since! She has commented on how easy it is to use/connect to her friends and the extra large screen. Our family's love affair with Nintendo products began when I was in the third grade and got a NES for my birthday!! BEST present of my childhood and my children's childhood since over 25 years later it STILL works...and they now play it. We have many systems from years of loyalty to Nintendo but this newest \"gameboy\" is awesome and my teenager loves that she can sync and play with her friends! Being social is a nice feature ours didn't have back in the day when they weren't even in color yet :) Would I recommend this product....YES Nintendo 3DS XL is worth the investment and hours of happy childhood memories  This was a smart purchase provided everything I needed and saved my kitchen counter. Loved the action and suspense. It held my attention the whole movie. It was a fast paste movie. The ending was a great part of the movie. This product is pretty good, but pretty good at best. While it has all the bells and whistles such as an FM Radio and a front facing camera, the phone experience is slow and pokey on some apps and when you first turn it on. And also what good is a 5mp camera without a flash built in. I can see the front facing cam as one thing but the back camera is another story alltogether.\n",
        "\n",
        "Had issues with the product detecting the battery at first. I did not know if the phone was defective or not. But this issue has passed for the time being it detects it correctly and charged fully. Batttery life can be run down in 1 hour and 30 minutes if you play games. Phone not designed for this activity.\n",
        "\n",
        "It does have a FM Radio tuner built in which really surprises me at this price point but then again Alcatel is good for including this function in their phones. Even has RDS function to display the song and artist currently playing on the radio.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall this phone is pretty good at $50 but don't get too confident because of the price because your patience is going to be really tried on this phone.\n",
        "\n",
        "One final suggestion. I would unpack the phone and then charge it overnight leaving the charger in. That way you get the maximum charge and less of a hassle the second time around. it works great it looks great it made the wife happy I absolutely love this phone, however, it's not that easy to use at first. There's so much to learn and no manual comes with it. You pretty much have to learn on your own, however, you learn something new everyday. This phone does everything. The camera takes absolutely the BEST photographs of any cell phone I've ever used! I was looking for a Sharp Carousel, but the one I wanted was not available ANYWHERE. This is a nice substitute. I used this card to add 4 USB3.0 ports to my older XP SP3 machine. The hardware is very good for the price. Everything I've tried, including external disk drives, works well and has very acceptable USB3 speed with this card. The drivers on the supplied disk were a bit dated, but current drivers are easy to find on the internet. The supplied drivers work well enough, but I did have some problems with external hard drives waking properly from S3 sleep mode and hibernation, updating to more recent drivers for 'VIA USB eXtensible Host Controller' (specifically version 6.1.7600.4301 dated 9/25/2013) solved that problem completely, the supplied drivers and the updated drivers I found are neither digitally signed, but neither has produced any hint of instability on my XP machine. VIA is the only chipset I'd consider for USB3.0, and it does not disappoint, transfer rates are very good even when writing to two or more external drives simultaneously. Start in less of 10 seconds after you connect to electricity power, faster hard driver and interface (usb 3.0) YAMAHA IS ALWAYS A GREAT QUALITY PIECE OF EQUIPMENT.......JUST UPGRADED TO A DIGITAL RECEIVER The Stones return to Hyde Park (London) after 49 years and put on an excellent show. The set list is excellent, the picture and sound are superb. A great DVD that Stones fans have to get. the \"hardware\" is okay, specially if the over all weight can be reduce by a few more . And the availability of the Photo Papers should be looked into. These speakers have a great base and I can tune it in or out with the sterio. Every feature sounds different from the radio to the ipad and the cell phone but they all sound great! Have always used the HP ink and have never had a problem with the cartridge or the ink. After watching the first movie with the kids, had to get the second one. My kids love this movie. Picked up the dryer and installed it myself. Worth the time and money. Does the job! very good value and sound for the money, easy to install I love these noise canceling headphones. They are light, comfortable to wear, they really cancel the noise (the best feature by far), and the sound quality for music is very good. A great product and I am very happy with my purchase. This is my 3rd iPhone and the best yet. apps launch super fast, the camera is much better than my 4s and the LTE is a MUCH faster cellular internet connection. It's so light it almost feels hallow. I like it because it's flat. Easy to put away. Works for big rigs. Family has one 4, two 5's and now a 5C. They just keep getting better with each release. Love it. Very light which is nice. I have had three others that was heavy. I got this on clearance for $19.00. They have many colors mine is Orange. really fun movie, doesn't get old, good quality DVD I did my research in the 300-500 dollar range and found this gem really stood out. I wanted a device I could use to hold my Bible library and still have room for my music videos ( I can also play SimCity using a microsim card). I got that along with a full Windows8 version and Microsoft Office to boot. Maybe next year I'll get an iPad Helium, but I'm in love with my T100 today! Simple to use, good capacity and fast response. Works well as primary picture storage on my digital camera. I haven't actually used it yet but the set up and random functions I've used have been positive so far When the success of your next quest hangs in the balance, or only one more hairpin turn stands between you and first place. When the clock is running out and your team must defend that flag at all... WOW! Far exceeded my expectations. This is a must buy product if you are in need of extending the range of your internet connection but are skeptical of using a wireless range extender. I highly recommend this movie for teenagers and adults only. This movie has some laughs as well as\n",
        "a interesting story line, definitely a keeper. This as a gift and I have love it! It is so easy to use Love the iphone 5. Its easily to understand and follow. Great quality and screen clarity. Super satisfied. Good items for the price, not so great color, but sound good Great collection set, don't really like that the movies are inside the sleeves in book for, and live free or die hard doesn't come with the unrated version Looks good, sounds good, and blends in with decor. Great headphones with great sound. Very comfortable on your ears. Love the zagg products, set up was tricky due to the size of the screen protector. I found it helpful to heavily saturate the protector to help you align the protector. Will definitely use again. This is the best phone for the price. The Note 3 is the best but more expensive. This has the most powerful mobile processor out (Snapdragon 800), a 1080 display, WiFi AC capability, a really great camera rivaled by few, and much more. Lag? What lag? This is a speed demon! Phone is ridiculous! Just buy it unlocked and take it to any carrier (except verizon) and you can thank me later. iPad mini features a beautiful 7.9\" display, iSight\u00ae and FaceTime camera, the A5 chip, ultrafast wireless and up to 10 hours of battery life1. And over 275,000 apps2 on the App Store made for iPad work with iPad mini. So it's an iPad in every way, shape and slightly smaller form. The refrigerator is an amazing appliace. We had bought a different one that made noise, and we traded it in for this one and it is amazing! Really quiet and it doesn't take up that much space. I actually recommend it. Great high performance router. Wireless range is excellent, even in the backyard. Secret to getting Chromecast on the wireless network is to use the firmware version that shipped on the device and setup separate SSIDs for 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz bands and not to upgrade to the latest release of Netgear firmware. Maybe the next iteration of firmware will be stable. Bought as a gift for the wife and she loves it. Wore it so much that the band wore out. Got three more bands and now she can match her outfit Deadrising 3 allows you to build your own weapons, upgrade your character and roam an open map. This game lives up to the standards of an RPG. This keyboard is really good, its very easy to set up, just plug n play. It is compact, hence why the keys are so close together and has some windows 8 swipe features on the touch pad that are good as well. Awesome movie, awesome cast. Great in 3D. Highly recommend You will laugh til you pass out! Paul is witty and a must for sci fi/comicon geeks! Really enjoy it despite not having more N64 games. Love the bigger screen. Great bond movie, the third act was outstanding, the beginning was a bit slow for me Great movie for anyone to watch, lots of adventurous fun especially for kids. Enjoyable collection of tracks from Neil's early days. Good mix of tracks. Audio is clear and crisp. You will want to play it over and over. for the price comparing to others, its all you need if you have good internet Great Game, Easy to play ,realstic graphics , cant wait for next addition Love using the Cromecast for Netflix! I can use my iPad or iPhone to communicate with the Cromecast! Bought this for my gamer brother a few months ago and have not heard any complaints. One neat feature is the camera tracking. When I was skyping with my brother the camera would follow him as he moved around the room. This monitor has clean lines and design ,thin black frame is easy to look at .The size is slightly larger than my previous monitor and is easier on the eyes. Harry Potter is a great family movie! The last two movies are truly epic &amp;no one should miss them! I quite enjoyed this movie, good cast and some pretty good scares My son loves this game. He wanted this because the app version doesn't have as many features as the xbox version. He is over the moon and has wants to play every second he can so he can find new fun features. We limit time so his interest is kept. Worth the money! great price for necessity. works well for all functions Coffee was on sale so thought I'd give it a try. It was smooth without any bitterness and on sale it was about $.55 per serving. I feel any k-cup under $.60 is a good deal. I like this Nokia media phone especially for the price it works great and does everything I need it to do I highly recommend this phone for anyone who wants a good cheap phone and someone who drops there phone a lot I bought this cause my ipod touch died, and I wanted another apple product for development purposes. I ended up taking it to classes, and I love it. If you have a cell phone and you don't get this you better have the insurance policy to repair the case if you drop it. Worked just as described. Was able to connect and set up smart TV to my network in less than 20 minutes. Has worked flawlessly since being activated. Perfect box set for anyone who enjoys the Tom Clancy/ Jack Ryan series. Great way to re-watch all of the movies before the new Jack Ryan movie. This is the best durable and dependable memory card for my DSLR Camera because I like to take lots of pictures . My girls &amp; I laughed til we cried! We've watched it several times and it gets funnier every time! Big fan of the show. The price is descent enough. Highly recommend this show to others. This equipment delivers everything the salesman said it would. This is th best ipad yet. Its smaller, slimmer and alot lighter than other ipads. The battery along time. This product is worth its price. Its very user friendly. I highly recommend this product. Another plus is that I can use it for hours and it never gets hot. This was purchased to replace my Jack LaLanne juicer, which was lost during a move. What an improvement! I'm finding the Breville superior in every way.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is easy to set up, to dismantle, and to clean. I like that I don't have to handle the blades - they're part of the filter basket. Juicing is fast, and the feed chute is wide enough that I don't have to cut fruit/veggies to fit. It's more compact than my old juicer, and I think it's better looking, too.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, it's far better than I expected for the price. This is a good superman movie, a definite improvement over the previous installment If it has got a bigger screen size, I'll love it more. Excellent gift purchase while at a cheap price!!!! Works great, only option, but if you are rough on the pinch points close to the connections it will tend to need to be replaced more often. This game is my favorite in terms of story line. Graphics are also very good. The game play is unique and enjoyable. I personally don't get into the ship battles but enjoy the many other aspects of the game. Im pretty much a beginner when it comes to photography. This camera is so easy to use ,you really dont need to know much more than point and shoot. Got it for Christmas and am enjoying playing it very much! This is a great conclusion to the cornetto trilogy I have used quicken for many years. Always keep track of families finances easily and accurately. It went on easy and it stays on. it resists scratches. I needed a HD cable for my new blu-ray player and am very happy that I had these recommended by a salesperson. I replaced the original grill with this one (my original one melted on account of my own stupidity) and it is a nice upgrade, but similar to the original. A bit bigger, easier to clean, nice light on the top to indicate it is ready. Barely fits four chicken breasts - not a big deal being that I'm only one person. Cleanup is a bit better than the original grill which is a plus. It's for \"coffee\" maker , I bought the item for a gift without knowing ow many possible choices there are - making follow-up gifts easier. This is the perfect mechanical gaming keyboard for users who want to have complete feel and control for wasd gamers. I like this product because it keeps kids moving and exercise while having fun My brother bought these for use with his laptop, because the internal speakers weren't loud enough. They work great for what he needs. Slim profile and very easy to install. Comes with a template. I like this game. Its an improved since previous version came out, so if you enjoyed previous DR games you will enjoy this one. I would not play it the game in front of the kids, to much blood and gore. Recommend, would recommend that you buy it. It greTly improved streaming on Netflix I like the look and the convenience of side pockets on different sizes, although is not too wide to hold the laptop, the battery cords and a few files. At my last job I was able to use my work PC for MS Office. When I left and no longer had the PC available to me, I struggled using iWork. I sprung for this when my frustration with Pages hit its peak. I found this to be very comparable with the PC version. Very easy to use, toolbars and commands I'm familiar with, and much better than the reviews indicate. I watched the debut of the pilot and was hooked instantly, if you like horror im confident you'll like this series Love this movie. Great story line and the blu-ray extras were fun to watch. The Belkin - Dual-Band Wireless Range Extender far exceeded my expectations. After reading several reviews on range extenders, I must admit that my trust in extenders was somewhat tainted. However, this Belkin doubled the range of my wireless network without compromising the performance of supported devices. I'm not in the habit of writing \"must buy\" reviews. However, if you are in need of a range extender, I highly recommend this product! This blu-ray player is small in size, but it is gigantic in features and very easy to use.\n",
        "Samsung quality and a reasonable price.\n",
        "I love this item! Bought this TV for our second TV. Chose for name reputation &amp; price. TV has great picture, easy to use remote, but only average sound quality. So far the only downside is that the TV has a strong chemical odor that I understand will eventually burn off. Great gameplay &amp; story,a little short on the story mode but other then that it's not your usual hack &amp; slash type which I thought it was at 1st but was I wrong about that incredible visual design, and the top-notch action is closer than ever to the real game The online play is difficult for a CoD player to get use to. The online play has a lot going on, people flying jets, helos, hummers, etc. The learning curve was just a little much for this veteran to other online shooters. I see a lot of potential in the game and give hats off to the publisher for the detail and intricacy the game offers. strong Italian blend. great for customers who like it. love picking up the coffee while at BB.  Great gaming mouse pad. Not too bulky or thick. Surface has a great response and feel. Deep rich color-black is very black. The sound is amazing!\n",
        "I feel the picture quality is better than Samsung!! After seeing them side by side, the LG has much deeper and richer color than the Samsung! I love this case. It's easy to use, lightweight. Great value. Good quality. Favorite online shooter. Its not as complicated or busy in the online. Story line and graphics are nice. Strong addition to the CoD legacy. This was a replacement TV for an older unit. The picture quality is very sharp and sound quality is excellent. I think that this battery is great for the price, and I haven't noticed a difference between these and another well known brand. The the subwoofer shakes my apartment. My friends who have come over since are asking when is the next movie night I have used this antivirus before, I have it on all our computer as well as our cell phones. i like the online support, majority of the time the do a great job Great little microwave. Does all we need. Great price. My daughter absolutely loves this game! She lives helping in the kitchen but her attention, motor skills and math skills make it difficult for her. But as a technological game, she can do anything and everything in this game. She's so proud of the things she makes and it's so educational she's learning while she has fun! Bought this machine for my wife to do her work related stuff, small learning curve but it beats our windows 8 desktop for reliability hands down. Battery life is great. I bought a similar one for my son to take to college 2 years ago he has had zero issues with his, he has dropped it into the wall and onto tile floor it only hurt the wall. I will only use this product on all of our electronics. No streaks Bought as a replacement for a none touch screen laptop. So far I am very happy with the touch screen and laptop performance. I had a Samsung 50\" Plasma that died. It was a very, very good TV. When it died I knew I wanted another large screen TV. This was what came to me with the similar features. I knew for the space what size, I knew for the money that Plasma was the way to go. I also knew that Samsung makes one heckuva TV. Very pleased with this purchase. This controller way better than the ps3 ones, it's bigger, feel better in then hands and a better grip. This camera is great I use it as a secondary camera when ever possible.\n",
        "The size and different mounts make it possible for me to get shots I never could get.\n",
        "The biggest problem I have is that the app and WiFi are unreliable. So the game brings something new to the gaming world with great graphics and story line. I would give it a try! Really a good TV with lots of features. We hooked it up to anntenna and being a Smart TV has lots of options. Really easy to use, great picture and sound. These are my second pair of Beats headphones (my first pair died after two years, and being accidentally dipped in a cup of coffee). The urBeats have the same great quality as my previous iBeats.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bass is deep, sound is crisp and clear, and they look &amp; feel like quality headphones. I love the new tangle-free cord.\n",
        "\n",
        "My only problem is with the sharp edges of the metal earbuds. They can be a bit uncomfortable at times, but generally fit really nice.\n",
        "\n",
        "The overall design is more refined than the iBeats were two years ago. It's well worth paying the high price. No special equalizer needed - these just produce fantastic sound. I bought this for my daughter. She loves it and takes it everywhere. Is works great for school. We bought this hdtv to replace an eleven year old toshiba 32 in tube type hdtv in the master bed room. Its nice to have flat panel new technology ,especially in a tv that was very affordable and has a beautiful picture and excellent sound. Good job Samsung. I love this pebble. I don't have to pull out my phone. i see everything on my wrist. thank you. awesome product. love to pick up the coffee for the office while at BB. Great coffee My boyfriend and i got this phone together. We havent had a problem with it yet. Had an htc one and it never had service. Glad we read other peoples reviews and went with these. I used to owe ps3 and this was an upgrade. I am loving this console! I like this laptop case. It's a nice soft black case that holds my laptop and electrical wire. I like the strength of the coffee, other coffees are just to weak. We've been using power toothbrushes for over thirty years and this one does an exceptional job. it seems to have much more power than any of the earlier models (all Oral Bs). received as a Christmas gift and I could not be happier. Every bit as good as other manufacturer's models. I brought this for my son Xbox One so he could play with others online. The new Xbox is taking time to grow on me. The dashboard for Xbox has required a extensive learning curve. The fan to the power supply is a little loud to me. But overall the system seems nice. The Kinect comes standard, which has some new great features. I enjoyed this movie a lot. It had a great plot, but it felt somewhat long I remember watching this movie when I was a kid. Love this bluray! Works well, easy to install....................................... I looked at this charger and the one made by Energizer and I said....... Nyko knows games and I made the right move, it looks great on my entertainment center and it charges supper fast, it has LED lights in the front that show the controllers charge level and it shuts off when the controller is charged. This is the way to go for charging when you have more than one controller. I give this my seal of approval !! I absolutely love this phone. It's easy to use and the apps are easily sync'd between my iPad and iPhone. Great tablet as you would expect from Apple. Works great right out of the box and you can setup using the last backup from your existing iPad (assuming you have owned one previously of course). It is still so new that the variety of accessories is still a bit lacking but maybe I'm just set in my ways and like the old stuff and want exact replacements! :). Oh and new speaker design is an improvement although front facing speakers would be much better. My daughter bought these to replace broken ones. She loves them. Good Product &amp; Value Compared prices &amp; other similar routers ; liked feature on Asus I like that the price was good It was easy to find Only had this extener for a few days, but bought if to fix a couple of dead spots in the back of the hours.\n",

        "Install and up and running in a few minutes. Problem Fixed. This is probably my favorite album by them yet. The vocals and music are great. There is a good mixture of styles. Some songs are very heavy and some songs are beautiful and soothing. This game has excellent graphics! I am not a big fan of first person shooters but this game has certain appeal. I was looking for a microwave that would accept large casserole dishes or large pizza. The Panasonic is right on size and power for heating/cooking. Very pleased with this purchase. universal Microsoft Office is a necessity in today's world Great product. Loved it and bought an second one for my self and even bought 3 more for gifts. The most important thing to me in a smart phone is the camera and the IPhone 5s has the best. I use it daily and am constantly surprised at how good the photos are, even in low light.\n",
        "It's an Apple product, so you know what you are getting, it may be locked down but it is easy to use and reliable. There are days when I do not even open my computer because the IPhone is so capable. This product is good for listening to your music on your phone,iPod and iPad. When I descided to purchased this item for my husband I was worried that he would not like it because he was so accustom to have paperback books in hand. when he first tried it he fell in love with it, so a gift well worth buying This item was a gift from my daughter to make swimming easier/more fun for me. Having music to listen to while swimming makes the time pass quicker. I am not a techy person-I struggled to transfer music from my iPod to the unit I wanted a phone that was easy to carry. I'm hard of hearing so I wanted good speaker volume. And when I wanted to use it, I didn't want to fool around with a lot of gimmicks. I have an RX100 MKII which is a $700+ camera. I didn't want to take any chances with an aftermarket battery. The best thing about using the manufacturers battery is they both behave exactly the same (charge time, drain time). I've used cameras with a replacement battery that would drain faster than the original and it makes it tough to be out in the field and not intuitively know how much battery life I have. If you love action and a \"man-opera\" this is the show for you. The compilation of the story of Ragnar into a singular show was done extremely well and the acting is top notch. A perfect depiction of the Viking culture. So much so that you feel like you're there yourself. A lot of people compared this to the 1965 film starring Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer. This is not that film. If that were released today it would be a top of the line production values and release in IMAX and filmed on location. This was filmed in a studio in New York State and the production crew did an excellent job. Carrie Underwood and Stephen Moyer were excellent in the lead roles and I was very impressed by Audra MacDonald as the Mother Abbess.\n",
        "The scenes with Maria and the Children are engaging. I loved all the musical numbers they were in. And what can I say about Audra MacDonald's Climb Ev'ry Mountain? Whereas in the film Robert Wise filmed the scene with space and with light. The producers of the TV event filmed it as a (my words) 'Come to Jesus, I have seen the light event' All in all, I am impressed. I can't wait until the next stageplay release by NBC/Universial. This was a great deal and I couldnt pass it up. Every movie in the series accept for the last 2 It's a fun way to kill some time, and challenging enough to want to not put down the controller. I've spent most of my time in the career mode, multiplayer has long wait times in the lobby, with little time racing I could not decide between the iPad and this galaxy note. After alot of research and playing with both, I decided on the galaxy note because of the features, ability to expand memory with micro sd card, and functionality that are not offered in the iPad. I am so happy with my decision. Lot of the content that is free has repeat commercials. I have tons of channels on the Roku 3. I have 1,700 apps music movies tech. The device updates often with more channels. This album was very good. The vocals and the instruments are amazing. It is different then their other albums though. Their style changed and it is not as heavy as their previous album I bought this for use in my Samsung Note 8. The class 10 version may be overkill for the Note but I prefer to have the higher speed if I decide to use it in my Nikon DSLR camera. The faster speed handles the video and quick shots easily. I've never had a problem with the SanDisk memory sticks. I always recommend them. This is a great option for your sonos speakers. Not needed but highly recommended. Easy one time set up These are perfect for on the go listening however I have trouble finding earbuds that fit into my ears (I must be some kind of mutant or something lol) and these don't quite fit. They start to get uncomfortable after a while. Everything else about them is perfect! This product was perfect for my iPad it did not require a computer download just plug it in let your iPad locate it and you are finished with set up. Took maybe 10 minutes total. It's a great product. I would highly recommend. Awesome product and already proved to be a product saver as I dropped the iPad once and no damage occurred! Learning new things every day and I have had an iPhone for 4 years. Easy to set up and easy to hold because of its' smaller size. Better than android any day. Until now I've never cared for sequels but THIS one is truly a keeper! Icing on the cake to the first one which is cute too &amp; sets the scene for this adorable sequel! I really like my kindle fire. It works really well, downloads music, good speakers, Netflix works great, tons of apps. Great product for the price. Overall a good solid case that also holds a pen and looks good I was nervous about submerging my GoPro - the thing is a $300+ camera and wasn't too sure about the waterproof housing. It works exactly as promised and the floaty is incredibly buoyant and your GoPro won't sink - period. i like it very much, it is very useful for my life. I've ordered 2 wireless remotes recently and the camo one is a huge success with my grandson. Works perfectly! You expect the best from Samsung, and they always deliver. There IS a reason their HDTVs cost a little more. You'll know why when you buy one. But if you're on the edge and money is an absolute issue, I'll say this:\n",
        "\n",
        "(enter jinx HERE??) I've only bought 2 Samsung HDTVs, but I'm so happy with them that I will always be a consumer of theirs. The simple layout, the thin design, the incredible picture.... Samsung makes technology seem flawless. There are quite a few models of the same basic HDTV per manufacturer. You get what you pay for. But if you purchase a Samsung HDTV, you'll always feel like you're getting more for your money. At least, that's the way I've felt. And every HDTV purchase I've made had taken into account all of the factors. From website to website I've roamed &amp; studied.... and every time I end up with Samsung. You just have to know when to buy &amp; where technology is headed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Will the TV you buy tomorrow be outdated in a year? With Samsung it will not, because they are the trend setters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Those who set the trends know their consumers. I know Samsung. Samsung knows me.\n",
        "\n",
        "D.P.R. Versatile, easy to use, extended play, portable device. The replacement lens cap fits well. Has full lens coverage, and snaps on and off easily. I like the fact that an elastic lens keeper cord was enclosed. Makes it a lot harder to lose the lens cap since it stays attached to the camera when not in use. Instructions easy to follow. Installation was a snap. Keeps me on track!! I almost always reach my ten thousand step, it's a great motivation! Easy to setup and perfect way to get and moves and sports Great movie by Guillermo del Toro, if you like hus work you'll like this movie Don't be that guy. Just get it. It's no difference than insurance. Be the geek.. Halo games are the best. My son recommended it and I'm glad I bought it! When you run they don't fall out easily and the sound is just amazing , I have all my products from sony, never once disappointed in them Good size printer. fits anywhere, Good quality. Quite &amp; fast This speaker sounds great and has amazing quality. The sound is great at any level. Easy to control from your phone. The speaker looks nice as well. I still can't believe that most video game magazines gave this game a low score. This game has everything it needs to be one of the best in the lineup, graphics, great story, gameplay and not to mention great voice acting and implementation of the Kinect 2. It plays like God of War and looks like the movie 300, this is a must have for a great hack and slash experience. I look forward to Ryse 2 and I give this one my seal of approval !! Excellant Product. Very Pleased w/ Previous HP All in One. Slow to boot up to perform task. Lots of prep sounds, but does top quality work. Quality product at reasonable price. I'm not sure what to put down since I have already said the last one I had has lasted for years and I only wanted a new one with wireless. This is a very comfortable remote. It works quite well and is easy to set up. I haven't used all the functions yet but will eventually. I like it I purchased this center-channel speaker for a surround sound system to hear dialogue better on TV shows. The speaker does the job well. It's a good service, price is ok and you do get Playstation plus exclusive. The people were friendly and helped with any questions I had. Apple products are the best. They sell themselves! Overall a great tablet. I would recommend this product to family and friends Easy to install. Excellent product. Plenty of storage space for the money. Love our new fridge! Had a side-by-side and could never see what we had in the fridge. This fridge provides easy access to everything and can see everything! No left overs getting lost! This is a great purchase. Set up was a breeze. Works great, and even if it messes up, it corrects itself. I just love this remote. Next time I will get the model higher than this one. Well worth the cost. Very happy with it! I bought this keyboard/case because of the backlit keyboard. The big drawback is with this case it operates more like a netbook not a tablet. The Bluetooth and keyboard do work well. They are great for working out, they stay put and they sound awesome!! I defiantly recommend them for anyone!! Needed cheap usb drive to store music for car and this fit the bill. This is a great lapdesk and my only complaint is that if I set it down say on the table or another surface my mouse slides down the pad.  great canceling noise. nice bass.\n",
        "Only negative is the headset has things that dangle and can be annoying Looks expensive it's very nice in black highly recommended Great case not only looks sleek it is totally functional. This is a great headset for the $. I love the sound quality and comfort. I just wish that it would fold for carrying. I chose the Samsung Note 8 over the 10 inch Tab because it is easier to carry and hold comfortably. The graphics are Samsung Great. The Stylus ability is very handy for quick notes on the go. It communicates (syncs) well with my Samsung Smart phone using Google Calendar. It would be especially useful for a Business Person on the go. I am extremely happy with this purchase. Friends like it too. Like the brand...the apps....the ability to store on i cloud and compatability with other electronics. Worth almost an hour wait at the mobile counter... Easy to load get about 300+ sheets of printing. You get triple the amount of printing with XL vs regular cartridge. Average priced and with the ink program is much cheaper When the series originally aired, I was able to catch it sporadically.\n",
        "Boyfriend had never heard of it, so I purchased the series after Christmas (one-time unbelievable sale). Wasn't sure if he'd be offended at the occasional brutality and sexually explicit scenes. He was hooked by the story line. First night we watched one episode, then the next...and by 1:00AM we were still saying: \" OK...just one more!\"\n",
        "The story centers around 2 Roman soldiers-their unlikely friendship\n",
        "and how Caesar came to power, his demise and all that follows. Truly gripping.\n",
        "Sorry I hadn't purchased two sets, because the sale is no longer offered. The asking price of $60.00 is still a value and an investment\n",
        "that is well worth the entertainment. After we had finished watching all episodes, we watched it all over again.\n",
        "Not for children. These movies are classics and its great to see them on blu ray in one set. I love the gameplay. You could not only play as a breve warrior fighting against your enemy, you could also play as a team leader. I really like the price for the microphone and the quality of the sound is very good. works great. id buy another one. Has great features. Being an Apple product, it has everything you need in a smart phone. I would recommend this camera for a professional or even a beginner. That is how easy this camera is to get great photographs. And to use this camera in the manual mode is just as easy. These things are great. I love being able to listen to my favorite music using my phone. Great buds especially for the price. Bass isn't fantastic but still descent. I used this all the time everyday and lasts me for a pretty good time. I've stuck with these earbuds after every break and don't plan on changing. Good keyboard for my Mac, I like the solar feature and gives you the added numeric pad. Only drawback is the wireless is specific to Logitech transmitter not bluetooth so you can't use it on multiple devices without moving the transmitter. Practical in size and offers many features such as a dual microphone. Excellent sound and speakers. Very durable! We had the same case for an iPod and it has held up through a lot, even when it was left on the porch when a snow storm came through! Search no more, this keyboard will leave you happy.\n",
        "\n",
        "I use this keyboard as my main keyboard on my desktop (mac), as well as for my samsung tablet. It effortlessly switches between them with a push of a button. I have owned two mac book pro's (2011-2013) and this keyboard mimics their keyboards perfectly, but with better features. I transitioned easily with more enjoyment out of this logitech keyboard because it solved a crucial issue that macbook pro keyboards have... key smudging. This keyboard looks exactly the same but has yet to leave that foggy/smudgy appearance on the keys, even with a month of use already gone by. I washed my hands often but mac keyboards still fog up, this one doesn't at all =). It's comfortable and good looking enough to where I'd rather leave it out and see it than tuck it under the computer on the keyboard tray when I'm not using it... and that's saying something. Perfect minimalist design with great functionality, though, not great for long periods of typing because of how slim it is. My son loves this for his mini, nice protection without being too bulky I am very happy with this mouse sometimes I forget to turn it off I wish it had a sleep mode like the computer does, however I am getting use to turning the mouse off after each use. I do like the fact that when I turn the mouse on it brings my computer immediately from sleep mode. Generate multiple reports. Help me get a snapshot of my finances at any time. Good record keeping and analysis This fridge is a great value and a good size. It has a lot of door storage and shelves. The freezer is descent size. This would be great for an appartment or house. Great console, the image quality, controller and almost everything works great. I chose to pick up this console in store and the experience was great too. When I heard everyone quoting lyrics I had to check it out. And I was not disappointed. Feeling every song on the cd. Right out of the box, easy set up, playing within 10 minutes! Love the graphics and easy to stream netflix! Bought this as an expansion to my kids ps3 very fast to keep up with the games. Extremely simple install. Auto load and unpack. Super quiet. great wide angel lens, takes some getting use to. Overall excellent if you get in in the package deal I liked the first one so much that I bought another and run them both at 2560x1440 - I am a programmer and need the screen real-estate. While doing C# coding in Visual Studio, I run the font at 8, and it is crisp and clear, thus minimizing eye fatigue.\n",

        "I'm also a gamer, and am currently playing DarkMod, a Thief-based game, and the display is simply fantastic.\n",
        "\n",
        "I've waited literally years for the flat panels to reach this native resolution, and at a reasonable price, and this monitor delivers the goods. Like the fact that it was cheaper then the keurig cup and it did the same exact thing. Keeps my coffee hot from morning until the afternoon almost!!!! Bought this case for my sons iPad, the fit is good and seems to protect the iPad well. its great , i used it so much and it still hasn't broken . Oh yeah! When I'm strapped for space on my thumb drive, I load up in the cloud and make it rain. Just use it. I loved the first one but I didn't enjoy the second one. They saved the best for last! A bit cheesy in some parts but overall one of the best sequels ever. Watched movie with my family and loved it. It's a must see. I'm not a picky coffee drinker, however, I do prefer a stronger cup of Joe early in the morning The Time Capsule was easy to set up and use. Seamless setup with Apple devices and good wireless range. Updated wireless transmitters and antennas over the old time capsule and holds more backup data (3TB). If the Zelda's of the OoT gameplay have worn you down, this game is a great palette cleanser to bring you back into the franchise. Fun and unique gameplay elements all around. Great product..nice display. I love the cway it turns and displays all my Keurig coffee cups. This router replaced another by the same manufacturer. The former\n",
        "was a less expensive model and would \"drop\" a Kindle on a consistent\n",
        "basis. This one is engineered to have a guest provision, the former did\n",
        "not . This one has been in service for approx. 4 weeks without failure as mentioned earlier. Such a useful and necessary product especially for students. id say worth the price overall. although installation was such a hassle for me. i called customer service twice and neither one was able to help mainly because i couldn't understand the workers. i ended up figuring out that i was typing the code wrong but then another issue came about. great! make sure to set up an account with microsoft (pretty sure its required actually) and whenever you get a little pop up on your mac make sure to login in with that account it'll save you so much confusing. hope this helps! For my business it works great and has all the options I need. Easy to hook up. I'm considering a second one for hom I have always been a fan of the Modern Warfare series and publisher Infinity Ward so, I was very excited to hear the formula was changing a bit and it has. No more owning the entire play field or cheap kills, CoD Ghosts is now a well balanced multiplayer experience for all players. The single player experience has some amazing moments and a great new story, I look forward to the later entries, can you say CoD Ghosts 2. I give this game my seal of approval !! I have enjoyed this iPad greatly, mostly for netflix and face timing with my grandchildren. It's easy to carry and has great sound Good product small easy to use. Easy to carry,my son takes it with him everywhere, he plays in it watch videos no complains. I have an iphone and bought this a couple of years ago. This year I bought it for a second phone. Nice product. I think this was a good choice for a \"computer\" as a secondary device to our main desktop. It easily connects to our WiFi Printer, and fact that it already comes installed with the compatible Word/Excel/Powerpoint applications makes it a great thing if you have kids in school (or need those applications for your job). If it was my only computer device, I wouldn't chose this; but as a secondary device I think it is a great choice. This is a great hard drive which I use with my MacBook ProR to store all my HUGE movie files and Photo files that were cluttering up my SSD. Stick some velcro on it and the computer and you have a fairly unclunky way to bring huge files along with you. Very low power consumption.\n",
        "IT's also preloaded with necessary software to make it a time capsule. This was actually purchased for someone who had never even used a tablet before. She loves how easy it is to use and the lightweight aspect of the mini I am enjoying mine so much I am getting one for my husband Fun family friendly video game system.\n",
        "With the 5 player option on Mario game everyone can play! Great camera , one you have to control rather than it control you. I suggest some basic classes or online tutorial before purchasing to full use it to it capability requires some basic camera knowledge other than point and shoot. We bought it because we didn't have a game system. It did a lot more than we expected. Great series. Most series by now start to die off, but not Fast Furious. They know how to keep you at the edge of your seats, making you want more with the action packed story line. This antennae is cheap and compatible with my LCD TV! I lost my job and was looking for an alternative &amp; found this! I have been telling my friends and family about it as I watch basic cable for free! Considering that I only watched 2 or 3 other networks outside of basic cable, I am happy! If you are looking for a cheap way to play great Nintendo games, the 2DS is the way to go. I would recommend this speakers to everyone. I never thought that I was going to get this quality for the price I paid...!!!! I needed some additional storage that was highly transportable. This unit was exactly what I needed. Easy to set up, easy to use and very well built. Combined with the great price I would recommend this to anyone. Awesome just have to clean often other than that great I got these for my 2 year old.. She wanted some headphones since she couldn't have her uncle's pair. And for some reason if they don't cover her ears, she doesn't want them. These were perfect.. Great for watching iTunes shows and movies without having to connect the computer to the TV. Excellent product, purchased two units would recommend to friend The single best thing about this monitor is the blazing fast 144hz refresh rate. If you're buying this monitor for any other reasons, you're looking at the wrong monitor.\n",
        "\n",
        "Pros:\n",
        "\n",
        "As I said above, the high refresh rate is the biggest plus of this monitor. This is really the only way I can describe it: imagine watching the 48FPS version of Peter Jackson's The Hobbit for the first time and translating it into a game. The only problem this brings is that you have to have the power to run games at a framerate that high. I can see a noticeable improvement with my Radeon HD 7950 in most games, but to get true 144FPS in everything you need to be boasting a GTX Titan or a 780TI (or use CrossFire/SLI).\n",
        "\n",
        "Cons:\n",
        "\n",
        "Blacks and viewing angles. Blacks often appear grey, and the viewing angle is awful; dead center is the only way to view the screen without color distortion. The viewing angle is even worse if most of the screen is covered in dark colors: unless your face is right on the monitor there is distortion along the edges of the monitor. These are the usual downsides of a TN panel. Color reproduction however is so-so; I use a configuration that boosts the saturation so I don't notice much of a problem there at all.\n",
        "\n",
        "Conclusion:\n",
        "\n",
        "If you're a gamer, get this monitor if you have the cash to shell out for it. It's a hell-of-a-lot more expensive than standard 24-inch monitors, but for the virtually non-existent input lag and response time it's worth it. Even if you can't drive 144FPS across the board, this monitor will future-proof your system if you end up getting hardware that can. As for photo/video enthusiasts: I don't know why you're even considering a TN panel monitor. Go for IPS.\n",
        "\n",
        "And as for speakers: they're the typical junk. Slightly better than your average monitor speaker, but not something you'd want for regular use. Excellent tablet for kids. Everything they need and it is very durable. Easy up get started. Buttons are smooth and easy to use. My last phone the buttons got stuck a lot Prevents phone from scratch damage and is transparent. this is a good product that really does its job!!! Great for non computr user.\n",
        "Have other tablets and so much superior Bought this to keep my new iPad safe. I wanted a case that would keep the slim form factor, not one that was bulky. This case fit the bill, and the whole kit is no thicker than my old iPad. Good projector for the money. Speakers that are built in are ok in a small room, but sounds has echo in a larger room. I love how clear the picture is! Great features like voice commands, hover feature and eye sensors make the phone super easy to use. I also like how easy it is to custom the layout. I love the cooking space on the stove and in the oven. I am still getting used to the convection cooking. This feature really fit the bill. This came with the computer. This is a great product with quality sound. I would recommend this product to anyone. this is a durable product for kids with many free apps. I am a big fan of the samsung galaxies series so I was sold on these tablets instantly. I am extremely pleased with the ease of set-up and the ease of use. The wifi feature is amazing! I would rather type using keys and not trying to hit the right letter on a screen. It holds my screen up very well as it gives protection against any damage from dropping. Tablet is nice size, initial start up and registration is time consuming, over all good tablet Makes face timing the easiest thing in the world instead of holding the I pad Great product and it is slim and easy to use and hold without any issues! This is a good cover but due to the straps coming off easily my kids take them off and play with them Hi there, This case was for my sister and she loves it FINALLY!!!\n",

        "A short hdmi cable thats cheap without being a piece of junk. Its got a thin cable so its flexible and space saving, as well as having great picture with no static so far. I use one on my computer monitor and one on my playstation. No problems so far... I'm just happy not to have a scrunched up 6 foot hdmi cable attached to everything even if all I need is a foot of length. I'm a fan of discreet but functional products, this fits the bill. This is my 2 iPod touch. Would of still had my old one but i dropped it and it broke. Therefore I had to get another one. High quality 32gb micro sdhc card. Class 10 so faster data transfer as compared to class 4 micro sd cards. I use this with my Lenovo Miix 2 tablet. good anti-virus without slowing down computer. protection with efficiency. Does a good job, no doubt about it. Fits a bit over-snugly into a USB slot (needs a bit more of a push than other USBs I own), but this is not a serious complaint, just an observation. I'm not a big fan of the design - I prefer simpler USBs with caps and found that Toshiba makes some slim ones with caps that I like better. I bought this PNY because I just really needed something quickly for what I was doing and didn't take the time to browse the catalog. I got this as a gift from my girlfriend. These headphones are stylish and comfortable. I got the blue pair and the the color is fantastic. They are over-the-ear headphones and they don't put pressure on my ears. The headband seems pretty sturdy and does not feel like it is going to snap. The sound is amazing. You can clearly hear the highs, mids and lows. The lows are deep and strong, but they aren't overpowering as the older Beats Studios. I use the ipad air very day for face time and its great Overall - terrific . Once I read directions so easy to use\n",
        "Works well . Would recommend to others This keyboard was so easy to set up with my iPad Air even though there was no instructions. Just go to settings and click bluetooth then wait till the keyboard recognizes the keyboard then click to connect. Used mostly while traveling and found to be great camera to mount to just about anything imaginable for all your motion shots. Given to me as a gift I'm so gadget illiterate but this was fairly easy to get use to. It made our movies more enjoyable.me and my husband really love to watch movies and get a real good soune. It makes it more real.\n",
        "What I love best is that the sepakers are very practical because of their size we can put them anywhere without really being noticed. I replaced a stainless steel samsung, this one is the Cadillac!! The sub is a very good low cost product that I very much enjoy This is a great movie! Recommend watching it. Love Xmen movies. I was looking for a deal (good price) in which it features touchable Touch Screen for my stand alone Computer that comes with Window 8. Not only that, it has an HDMI for my Mac Mini. Also I like the built-in USB Hub so that I could hub it out to four more USBs.  Perfect size, great battery life, perfect amount of storage for pictures and videos of an average user. NEEDED TO SET UP TWO TVS IN MY RV SO I COULD USE ONE OUTSIDE Get all around movie. Great action.Highly recommend Kids love it. Can't seem to get enough of it. Go Turtles! The Lenovo Miix 2 8 is a decent little tablet. Good screen resolution and audio. It has Windows 8 which takes a little getting used to. Very easy to setup but sometimes it drops the wireless signal and it takes a while to re-access. Because it's relatively new, there aren't many accessories available in the market. Plenty of power and functionality for such allow price ($249). Been looking for this and love it. I would reccomend tjis too I am so happy I bought this soundbar. Makes me feel like I'm in the middle of what I am watching. I like jet li. Good fight seen and story line..... this computer was exactly what we were looking for. Very functional. Took some getting used to but the touch screen motions are really great. It a great movie my daughter enjoyed , it a family movie Good product! Protects my laptop and looks good at the same time! Love the game. Play it all the time. Kids like it also. I love this album . It has some of their otjer songs on it too I tried another maker but you can't beat HP for printing photos. Glad to be back My first impression after playing some with this printer is that it is a really great printer for the price. Two things have modified that opinion a little. First, the price seems to have gone up considerably since I purchased it for $150. Second, the scanning to computer speed is the worst I have ever seen, despite the fact that the printing speed for both text and photos is very reasonable, as is the copying speed. Although I bought the printer primarily for it's compact size, multi-functionality, and reputation for excellent photo printing, I must admit to being impressed with some of the nifty gimmickry, like the self-opening trays. I have not used it enough to say how the ink usage is. I really like this remote -- I actually replaced both my harmony one and my harmony touch remotes with this. I hated the touch remote!! The touch screen looked nice but was terrible to actually use - scrolling through pages looking for a button ?? trying to hit the channel up button on a touch screen -- terrible . This is great-- easy to use -- simple remote and then if I need to can use my iphone for more complicated tasks -- aslo iphone app connects to my harmony for easy programing !!! Best harmony I have owned by far !!! -- O My wife had an older model which broke when she had a hospital stay. She is enjoying the newer model with the backlight. This movie shows the life of Danny Greene. Cleveland's infamous Irish \"mobster\". Very accurate and very entertaining. I recommend watching the extras as well. I like both the main actions. Good fight seens.... It's nice to have a Mac!! Once u have u'll be addicted!!! Great device for price. Met my needs. Was surprised at how fast I was able to copy over 20,000 pictures to this device I enjoy the fact cheaper than the standard controller and it is not black. Seems to be no different than the original controllers since it is only used a a fill in while the wireless are charging. Nice to use in place of wireless controller without worrying about battery dieing. I use this spearker in my kitchen with my phone for itunes and my ipad to increase sound for watching tv programs. If the fan is on over the stove or the dishwasher is running it is hard to hear shows on the ipad. The sound is okay for the price. I also like the look of the speaker it blends in. Very easy to sync after downloading the LG Bluetooth app. I have an otterbox case for my iphone and you can't use the rapid charger with the case on. I would recommend this item but just be aware of the drawbacks. I plugged it into my sound system and, within minutes, was listening to albums I haven't played in years. I found stuff in my attic I didn't even know I had. I'm not an audiophile so I have no opinion on the quality of the sound. I just know this machine does everything I need it to do. This is a super nice wristband for iPad Nano. It works perfect for my Nano. There was not much to choose from on the shelf so I was lucky this one works great. I got this product to clean my phone and tablets and works great. Highly recommend had an old flip phone. this is nice to break me into the world of today sounds great very good product well worth the money Typical do it yourself stand. Surprisingly solid, quite sturdy. He was really funny as all ways. Will buy the next Easy to use and clean. Works well in my Keurig. You can use and coffee, tea leaves or cocoa mix in it. Purchased for my wife, Does a great job of protecting the display when closed with the rigid cover. The cover goes from cover to stand easily. it works like the box says.use it every day for school. So far so good. This was competitively priced, and easy to find in the store. I always use this brand! Kids can't get enough of this! Great pack. Might have to get one as a gift. I like produce very much,. It is also very good if you want play the angry birds., There are a couple other book covers made by other companies..for the Samsung Tablet...but, the Samsung Tablet Book Cover truly is the best one. They are pricey. But, once you start using it you will realize the quailty of the Samsung Book Cover. I love my kindle fire hd. I take it with me everywhere. These guys are the epitome of classic fun\n",
        "An all american classic\n",
        "A great piece of Americana\n",
        "Every guy should own these DVDs!!!! Open box and plug cable to cable so picture work on tv Everyone in America and overseas should have this appliance in their home. The beats executive headphones sound great and look and feel great. This is a good printer for home use, has all the functions most people will need. It is easy to set up and use. I would recommend this to other home users. I use this with all my mobile electronics and love it. Never have any problems with them either. I love this soundtrack! I was so glad to find it after learning it was out if print. So great lyrics, uplifting music. Just loved it. Brought back great memories! Good cd has good songs..,!....,.. it also for a good price this is another addition to my SOA dvd collection that I needed If you are an iPhone, iPad, Apple user, this is a fun product to watch everything on a big screen tv. This was competitively priced, and it is a real work horse! I like the styling! Easy to use and set up! Zagg products are great. Take your time and make sure there's no dust around while you're applying it and you'll have flawless screen protection for the life of the product you're protecting. I've never had a Zagg screen protector show signs of wear like others do by getting bubbles and scratches. Love it great size great value I use it all the time. It is easy to learn and has lots of great features Great picture and easy to use. Easy to set up. We use it in the kitchen to watch during breakfast and supper. Great low cost for an 8gb flash drive that works in multiple devices. I bought this for my mom to replace her pc. It works better than I thought. She doesn't do anything on her old desktop, that she can't do with her new iPad. She loves it and uses it all the time. Samsungs galaxy gear watch works great. The microphone works great and calls are crystal clear. gets in your purse very easy, i have my medical books and you can change the back light to read confortable Like the look of this case and it seems to protect well. this DVD R/W isJust what you need since Apple doesn't supply one on their system. You would think that the cost of the Mac would include a dvd player and read write unit but it doesn't. so you have to spend more to buy one. the iPad is a well made quality product with great features. as with all Apple products it is made to be used. It is just the right size. The weight is light enough for a senior citizen. I pack it in my purse when I travel. It operates just like my cell phone. I really like this device. I can do emails and play games. It replaces my laptop and it is really handy when I travel. This product is very good and so easy to install! The quality is great for the price! Great printer for the price. It its very fast and I like the two paper trays. I have been a long time customer of VM and am very pleased. Unless you travel out in the middle of no where, the coverage area is just fine. Why pay more for a massive national coverage area you will never use. Great Price! East to put on and take of.f. This style slimmer than others so looks better and fits in pockets better. I needed this to help complete my SOA dvd collection Again Richard Attenborough delivers an excellent product. I was a fan of Planet Earth, so I was expecting nothing less from this new BBC production. Beautiful pictures and excellent narrative from Mr. Attenborough. I cannot wait for the next production to be released. This one is two thumbs up! Love it! Easy to use. Cant wait to use it Snorkeling! Overall, great little gadget for the money for only 20 bucks. The quality and performance was perfect. I am satisfied with the product; Majorly it properly functions as it should. There has been repeated glitches in where the router has frozen and required hard resets in order to reboot/restart the signal. I wanted something that looked good (not bulky or too camera geeky), but would also protect my camera at the same time... this case does exactly that. Lightweight moves well,Its just what I needed. Works well with my computer. great tv for smaller den or office room,easy setup with out cable box. One of the most dependable PDA's I've ever used. Compact size makes it easy to side in the brief case. Not the cheapest, however, the quality and the bullet proof operating system makes Mac a must for me. MAC wireless keyboard is easy to use and works with out smart TV. We also use it to help navigate the Apple TV. It's light weight and looks cool. I love these and they were a great buy. They made my laptop sound so much better and they are so loud with certain websites that I have to turn down the sound on my laptop at times. I got them for about fourteen dollars because I had used my five dollar coupon and they are well worth the money spent and they also have a cushion around where your ears are resting on that makes it comfortable. Makes life easier. Instead of always to have to take my Note 3 out of my pocket to see texts I can see it on my watch. This is a good product and easy to use. You will probably find that the iPod touch meets the needs of more serious music users. The Pebble was easy to set up and connect to my phone. It never has any problem reconnecting when I'm in range of my phone. I bought a couple replacement bands and love that I have the option to interchange them whenever I want. The apps are a little limited in capability and variety, but I expect that to get better when the next software release comes out. The buttons are a little hard to press, but I'm getting used to them. I love the cover I have brought my kindle. I recommed it. We got this printer to replace an older HP 8600 series office class printer as we needed wireless. The Epson is just as fast and prints at least as well. The connection to wireless was simple and quick, but did require a brief install on each computer. Overall very satisfied. I would highly recommend the Beats to everyone. The sound system is amazing...Dr. Dre has created a outstanding product loved by athletes as well as everyday people like myself. I purchase all of samsung products because they stand up the their name. I've always wanted to invest in an iPhone and I am glad I did. It is so much easier to use than my previous cell phone. Previously had problems pocket dialing, and no longer have this problem. This is a great phone for the price. I upgraded from VM Optimus Elite and am very pleased with the phone. The Optimus F3 has a larger screen and way better reception. I am getting a couple of bars in places I would not have any before. I basically bought the phone because I wanted the lager screen and I was surprised to find 4g in my area as the VM coverage map online needs updated, a pleasant surprise indeed. I have been a long time VM customer and see no reason to change as their coverage area suites my needs just fine. No need to spend extra for massive nationwide coverage area unless you travel out in the middle on no where. Keep in mind that android version 4.0 or higher, you can not store apps on the sd card, but I find the user accessible 1gb internal storage plenty for my needs as I keep all my music and pictures on the sd card. Finally, get some earbuds as the speaker on this is not all that great for music. My family loves the fondue pot, it's fun and a great conversation piece and it is very user friendly and heats well.. Bought when on sale so I bought two to provide plenty of memory for my new Canon D60. Easy to set up, and get started. There is a very shallow learning curve when transitioning from the PS3. New controller design is excellent and more comfortable to use. This drive set up very easily on my Mac. I purchased aieesoft's blu-Ray ripper for Mac. It works so seamlessly with the blu-Ray burner. Love it! It is an outstanding all in one drive for the Mac. Great cover for my I-Pad Air\n",
        "Makes for great protection Great price for size more room on my phone more music more photo. This was a great purchase especially on sale. Having the transforming D pad was a nice upgrade from standard xbox controller. The blu ray player was easy to set up and use with great picture quality. Using a stylus makes it so much easier to use the touch pad devices and it keeps the surfaces clean. It's a cat5e cable. Gets the job done, and for a 50' on sale - was a great deal. No issues with it at all. I bought an all in one touch screen system because I was tired of having a bulky tower. Things were a bit confusing at first, but after a couple of months I got accustomed to it and now I like it quite a bit, although my 11 y/o son uses it more for viewing videos and playing Minecraft than I get to use it for my intentions. had lg front load that was 10 years old was great so went back with lg washer and its much quitter and less vibration. Washes better than older washer Great USB for price. Holds a lot for how small it is. Great spacesaver, great price, holds plenty of kpods I've bought this particular model for several staff lounges over the years and it's just perfect for heavy use heating up meals and beverages by multiple users. Not too many features, very durable, and easy to clean up spills and spatters. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this for home use. I bought on sale and I know we'll get many years of service. Great fit and I love the feel of the product. Protects my kindle nicely  IT IS VERY AWESOM I CAN WATCH YOUTUBE, HULU, NETFLIX, AND EVEN SURF THE WEB ON MY TV. I THINK ITS BETTER THAN APPLE TV BECAUSE I CAN STREAM IT FROM APPLE PRODUCTS AS WELL AS SAMSUNG AND ANDROID PRODUCTS. SO I WOULD DEFINITELY WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT I bought this to replace my wired printer and so far am extremely happy with the purchase. It was easy to set up, located my network easily and once I added Epson printer apps can print from my phone and tablets. The self feeder and two sided printing option are a definite must have. We have printed plenty of copies and even pictures with great results. The relatively small size fit well in my desk the only issue I run into is the output tray does need ample space to open. Great dishwasher for the price. It outperforms my last dishwasher that cost almost three times as much. I got this case for under $20. Compared to other Kindle cases available through Amazon at triple the price, it is an excellent value. Well made, and seemingly will last a while. This concept is very easy, tasteful, and I really enjoy using the SodaStream products, this flavor is my favorite so far! My 6 year old nephew was very excited to get this character. This Samsung Tablet was a Christmas gift for me. I really did not need it. But, I have found out that I truly enjoy this Samsung Tablet. The size is perfect. The quality is clear. The features are really nice.\n",
        "The camera is super good. Photos are crisp. I have a desk top, lap top, Samsung smart phone, and now a Samsung Tablet! I bought this as a nice wireless mouse for work. The extremely small USB doggle, makes it perfect to keep plugged in to the laptop while on the go. I have been using it every day for over a month now and battery life is still going strong! Eventually, the battery move out of right position and it needs to reset the battery. It could be a problem only at my device but it is easy to fix that. Apple continues to make better products, this new iPad Air is exception. The operating system is better, it's easier to use, it's lighter and the quality of the screen is great! I have the NBA 2k franchise dating back to 2011. What I like about getting the most current version is the updated rosters. This year, however, seems to have better gameplay and more realistic AI. I bought these in lieu of spending a fortune on \"beats\" headphones. I think I made a very very good purchase and recieved a phenomenal value. I use them every day! I have mine set up in a north facing window and the reception is great. worked like a charm, straightforward gift card. good selection in the store. it's a basic dvd player. no bells or whistles. it plays dvds as it should. it was simple enough to hook up. i'm not really sure what else to say about a dvd player. if you don't care about having a blue ray player, i can't see why anyone would spend any more on another dvd player. this was the cheapest one available and it's great. I don't need the greatests headphones in the world to make me happy, these are a fair priced set of ear buds and they are very very good! Comfortable and they do cancel noise pretty well. Punk color makes the lady friend happy as well :p I purchased the IPad mini smartcover case after owning several other cases that just didn't hold up! I've been very satisfied with being able to take my iPad mini along in my purse without having to worry about it being protected. Great phone over all. The only issue is if your switching from an iPhone to the galaxy. You will not recieve messages from iPhones, due to your # is program under iMessage This is a good product for the avid runner with the ipod 7th generation nano. It prevents water damage and is easy to clean and it is very durable. I would highly recommend this product to the serious runner. My fianc\u00e9 bought this mousepad for gaming on his computer and he really enjoys it so far! my son loves it hes 15 and helps him out greatly feel it helps him be a better student These cartridges work great with the printer. Easy to install. It is a good case and it seems it seems like it will protect my tablet. It seems strong. I'm not going to throw my tablet on the ground to check if it really is as strong as I think! It there were an accident and it fell to the ground I feel this roilsinimize the chances if damage. Great picture quality in a camera that is loaded with useful features. Pretty easy to use. A novice will need to read the manual but should pick it up quickly. This is another great product from Apple. The camera is improved, the security features are great and the phone is really light. Very comfortable in your hand. We are having trouble linking up to the Wi-Fi. The disc that came with it is not informative. Works well and is really quiet...picks up more dog hair then most other machines. This chair is comfortable but it only came in the black color and I would have preferred a different color. Great help in helping signal strength in my home. Setup instructions could be a little better Basically just bought it to play online but there are some cool features Bought this for my hubby for Christmas and he loves it. He takes it everywhere with him. The internet is very fast on this tablet. I am very pleased with my purchase and the price was great! This is a softer type screen protector instead of the harder plastic that holds it's form. Took several tries to get it on, but serves it's purpose. The material does not allow for any greasy finger marks which is a plus, but it also causes a sticking when your trying to swipe or touch your tablet. I guess any screen protector is better than none. Very good product for regular runners/excercisers. Provides good sound quality and is very comfortable even on long runs. I have had no problems with water or any other malfunction. This has been everything we wanted and more. Easy inexpensive monitor. I originally purchased a Netgear router to work with the Netgear cable modem. The Netgear router was horrible with known issues. So I purchased the Linksys. Should have bought it first have used Linksys on many different installations. Always plug and play you are up and running within minutes. Also easy to secure. I purchased it as a part of a Daily Deal for $35 so I couldn't pass it up since my other controller's thumbsticks are starting to float around making navigating in most games a pain!\n",
        "Xbox 360 controllers are incredibly comfortable as per usual and this one is no exception. Transforming d-pad is kinda gimmicky but it works well. The thumbsticks feel great too and I don't think they'll wear down as much as my older controller since the material used feels different and more coarse. We were always having problems with our netflix stopping and getting stuck reloading for eternity and also having to unplug our router because we'd lose internet or lose connection to internet. Since we got this router, we've had no problems whatsoever. It's fantastic. Fast and always stays connected. We run two laptops, 2 mobiles and a smart t.v. occasionally a tablet is running too. No problems at all thanks to this router. This show is awesome!! I never know what to expect, except the 'good guys' winning! Christian Kane is awesome and hot! These cartridges work great with the printer. Easy to install. Can't complain too much about the product. Did the job well no questions or buts about it. I'm tough on my phone and was happy to get this cover as it's not as bulky as the commander. Very happy with this antenna! We use it inside and it works great, much better than I expected. Easy to put together. First time we scanned for channels we got 17 digital channels. Later we changed the position of it and scanned again and now we get 25 channels. I like the color that this cover adds to my phone. I like that it replaces the cover to my battery. I only that the cover would trigger the phone to automatically lock and unlock. It keeps my phone from being too bulky so I can still slip it in one of the pockets of my purse and even the back pocket of my jeans!! I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she wanted something that would help provide a good base for all of the body fat, water weight, blah blah. She loves it and said it was extremely easy to set up. It also looks high quality. This show is awesome!! I never know what to expect, except the 'good guys' winning! Christian Kane is awesome and hot! Works perfectly, but kinda hard to screw up something like this. Over all it's a great phone, the camera takes awesome pics. Faster then any other iPhone. The phone is iphone. What can I say! I love iphone.\n",
        "I hate their Pensive inner stingy on giving you more freedom with your phone ....personality.! Or lack there of..\n",
        "But all in all, Iphone is the best. Tried several locations. Unfortunately my vehicle doesn't offer any dash areas that are flat enough for the large suction cup, but with the easy adjustability of this mount I was able to choose from several locations attaching to the glass. Very easy to use, inserting and removing the phone are a breeze. Bottom support is also adjustable to allow for charger and headphone plugs. I love this, memory is important to me, I will be buying more. Item was received in perfect condition, fast to ship. Tastes fairly close to cherry coke, but not my favorite flavor out therefor the soda stream Great CD! Love Gavin Degraw, Very easy listening!! This works awesome. It was easy to set up and I enjoy being able to access my iTunes videos, music, etc. on the large tv. Although my phone is not an iPhone, I was able to trim the sides and they worked just fine. Bought to connect large headphones to mini jack of tablet or smartphone while traveling. Sets up easily sounds great! Just bought but seems durable! Holds pleanty of data on my cell phone. I use the camera quite a bit and it holds all of my pictures and video. It's a card for Microsoft credit I will use primary for purchasing games and other gaming content on my xbox 360. No more silly math needed to figure out how much money gives you this many points so making purchases on the Xbox is much more streamlined! Hello,\n",
        "I would recommend this stand for anyone look for a great deal. It is very sturdy and the price was very good. I use it hold my 50'inch TV. So if you are looking for a bargain get it. Great purchase for the price. Easy setup and clear trouble shooting directions. Looking forward to using all the functions in the future. Love this microwave! The size for countertop is appropriate, preprogrammed buttons make cooking easy, love the melt and soften features. Price was right too!! Works great with the soda stream and tastes just like root beer! I love this new controller but I just wish the battery life was longer. All in all nice controller Good basic filter to protect lens from being scratched. This is a wonderful device for the fitness enthusiast. Overall its an amazing phone . The camera quality is very good and you can access almost anything on this cell phone . I barely have problems with it . This is a lite-weight easy to carry case for my ipad. It opens and closes with ease and the cover folds flat behind the ipad. The cover also becomes a stand for a sideway view of whatever you are doing. My only regret is that I wish there were a clear envelope that acts as a screen protector. This is a great CD! I would definitely buy it again, easy listening! Really great and inovative watch. Well worth it, I find wearing it over nicer more expensive watches. It's so cool to have multiple watch faces and own something the majority of people don't even know exists. This is an amazing desktop. the screen is so large, it's like having a tv. it's fast, easy access to everything I need. My husband and I have out own accounts and it's great to customize the desktop just how we like it. Graphics in the game are great, however when you finish the story line you cannot go back and pick up weapon plans or items- you have to start a new story line. Game is greet and story is great also. I always buy the madden games, and this was my first Xbox One game purchase. I would,d have to say it obviously is the best, due to the graphics update, but really doesn't add much more. You can see your opponents play selection using the smartglass feature which is pretty cool. I wish you could take a created player into online franchises, but oh well it fulfills my football needs, I watch a LOT of Netflix on this. It streams perfectly and has very good video quality and sound. I think it's the perfect size and the videos display full screen. Polaris opens docs with no problem. Very easy to start using although I was ahead of the learning curve since it's just like my Galaxy SIII phone. Glad I got the brown one as I think a white border around the video would be distracting. Packaging for shipment was awful but product was not damaged. Works great!! Amazing graphics. I have only played play station 3 prior to this purchase. The amount of games available is amazing. I highly recommend Halo 3. The 4 gig system is a great value for the price The tv is great. The size is just right for the room. I was a little disappointed with the tv not having more inputs. It also is a lower end model and I would have appreciated the salesperson tell me this. Nothing was said and I had to come back and buy another 100.00$ worth of cables. I wasn't happy with that. The kindle is a lot of fun with great apps. The kids play games a lot. Nice display and trouble free. Best bag for the money. My 10 year old loves to use it with his new Canon T3 It would be easy for students to carry around and use for research.\n",
        "we take it on trips with us to find restaurants , gas stations and hotels as we'll as thing to go and see. Xbox 360 owner, casual gamer, IT professional: Xbox One easy setup - some difficulty finding my way around to start with - took a solid 2-3 hours to fully understand where things had been moved to - have to sign up for Microsoft account for downloads which is an annoyance - Can use with Kinect turned off without issue I had purchased a less expensive product to save money, but it was not worth it! This product works great and works as stated on the package. This is a great router, we have a lot of devices and I can manage all of them through the router. So far it has worked perfectly. No need to reboot it to get things moving again. It protects my screen. Worth the price for the lifetime warranty alone. Comes with application solution, microfiber cloth, and installation squeegee. Works great on tiled/wooden/laminate floors but useless in carpeted area due to the fact that there is no way to adjust air flow direction (horizontal flow is decent but vertical flow is only in downward direction.) Awesome for the mini. It is needed to protect and keep in new condition. Bought this bag on a whim and have been very happy with it! Out of the box and backing up my iMac in under 5 minutes. Super easy! This refrigerator has all the features that the more expensive one had. it was a good choice for our kitchen. So far we haven't had any problems with it. Taste great on cold day or night warms the hold body Not having been raised in the digital generation, it is often mind-boggling to figure out how to use all the fun stuff now on the market. This is finally one product easy to set up and easy to use. Love it! This is a must have item for anyone's smart phone. It protects the screen, is easy to clean and you don't lose anything from picture quality. Perfect for use in my airbrush studio. Nice bass, good sound. Like the Bluetooth. I love this product it's perfect to take with you everywhere, It's a must for most Wii games and can come in handy for Wii U games. Nice camera bag, I have two of these. It fits the go camera and accessories well. Buy it as it is the best for every day use. Great battery life My previous game console is an ORIGINAL XBOX! It still works great, but it's about 12-13 years old. Graphics not that great and neither is the performance. My wife wanted a WiiU for exercise games. My daughter is a bit of a gamer, so she wanted it, too. They both love it. I'm not much of an exerciser... but I LOVE the sports pack! The game play is amazing. Awesome story line. Truly a fun game! I was looking for an underwater camera this will do fine. It is a typical memory card. I'm using it for a camcorder at work. The player came with cable connectors for audio only. I'm not sure if this is normal or not, but I was disappointed that I had to go out and purchase a video cable just to watch a movie.  I love the new design of the earpods. I have small ears and I could never get the old ones to stay in my ears. Even though these are on the uncomfortable side for me, they stay in much better than the old ones. I have been a customer of Net10 for about 2 years and had the opportunity to activate a SIM for a new phone I acquired. My husband had done the same for his phone a few months prior and it was simple. My experience was not as seem less. I had to place numerous calls to Net10 customer service. Approximately 6 hours over a 3day period. After being told by a rep that I would just have to call back the next day to get the SIM activated, which would have been day 4, my phone miraculously turned on. So the SIM and phone work great. How I still do not know,but I'll take it. This game is great bought it for my little bro that is 8, loves his super heirs so knowing he can create a super hero was cool. I recommend it for 10 yrs and below If you're looking for a survival-horror game, it doesn't get much better than this on the Wii U. It's a pretty fun game that has you on edge throughout. Not for the faint of heart. I really needed this to help cool my laptop since I use it so much. Very impressed with the directing and plot. Left me eagerly awaiting the next film. I think this product is great. It is the prefect length from my TV to the blueray player. It gives a great picture and sound. I would purchase another product by this brand. I enjoy my Apple TV. I wish it had more free apps. I brought it home and installed it within minutes. It looks HD on my tv. Good purchase. Great features. Got the tIVo after my fourth cable company DVR started to die. So far works great and functions better than my cable DVR ever did. good case for the kindle fire hdx. holds the tablet at a good angle for reading and offers protection in case we drop it. I only use this as a home media center, the connection to my wi-fi is way more reliable than my Apple TV and being able to store all of my movies, pictures, and music right on it is priceless. HDMI connection to TV is very convenient but the lack of being able to enlarge icons, menu screens, and file names is troublesome. Even with a 55\" TV from 8 feet away I have to strain my eyes to read them. Love my phone. Kind of sucked the screen is fragile so it was bummer from the start but I do love its features. Thank you This replaced the Netgear N750. The nighthawk router is super easy to set up. The Netgear Genie enables users to manage their network effectively. I put the Genie on my Sony Tap20 laptop and also on my iPhone. The range/signal on the Nighthawk is awesome. I no longer have to use the netgear adapters at the far corners of my house. If a wireless network that will support multiple users requiring streaming capability and playing online games all at the same time then this router is for you. My old router drop signal all the time I install the wireless router an have not drop a signal !!! Didn't want to splurge for the high price name brand. Really love the fit and feel of the skull candy headphones. Love that I can detach when using the Surface Pro 2 as a tablet. Easy click on and off just like they show on the TV commercials. The color purple makes my computer easy to find when I place it anywhere. Plus, I just love the feel of the keyboard. This is not a must have, but I prefer the keyboard and the fact that I can type easily while the surface pro 2 is on my lap. I really liked this product. It was easy to use, fits my protective case well. I already use my iPad so much more in my day to day life. I would recommend this product to everyone I was pretty impressed with the tablet controller and the way most games use it. Granted, the system's library is not as robust as it could be, but I'm enjoying what it currently has to offer. If ur use to COD easy kills well not here, cool\n",
        "Game and good effects, more freedom to do more thing rather that the same old style with is first person shooting fun game to play, a lot of figures you can add, challenging This iPad is a great size to carry with me all the time. I spend a lot of time at dr appointments so this is a perfect thing to carry along. So convenient and enjoyable! Replaced very old m/w and it takes some getting used to, but it cooks more rapidly than the old one. Excellent product. Buy the XL version and pay a bit more but it lasts much longer. I returned the trackpad and got this instead. The trackpad must be on a hard surface in order to do some functions. I couldn't use it on my couch because of that. This optical mouse works on most any surface so much better for me as I only use my mac as a media center from the couch. Much thinner and lighter than previous model. 128gb has 2x my previous models storage. Faster processor. IOS is very stable and user friendly. Easy to travel with. The Xbox One controller is an even better design coming from an already great controller (Xbox 360.) I really like this series. When this went on sale I purchased it right away. Love the mini iPad. It's an excellent size for smaller hands and works wonderfully and is an easy set up It protects the I pad, looks good, and the price is right. We had a gift certificate so decided to purchase the Soda Stream. We have been surprised at how much we enjoy using it. There is a vast variety of favors, both sugar free and regular. The tank has lasted a long time, and you can take it to participating retailers and get a discount on your next tank. I would advise buyers to purchase the optional extra bottles so you can have several flavors in your fridge. Its fun to use and the sodas are yummy. Bought this to be able to take and store my pictures on my DSLR Perfect for the iPad. would buy again and recommend to others This cable works perfectly and a great price for a name brand.\n",
        "cable seems solidly built. I bought these to connect my WiiU to TV (no 2nd HDMI port). Easy to connect. It was our first i-pad. We enjoy to bring it for traveling. We are satisfied for light weight and fast internet access! This is a very cool product. I probably would have purchased this just for the case itself. It holds several different types of batteries, so I don't have to dig through separate packages or cases to find what I need. I highly recommend this for people who like to organize their batteries! My new Tomtom is great watch that I love and am very happy that I bought. It works great for my workouts! I like the phone,its very smooth to operate.,user friendly and the camera is awesome with a great clarity Picture quality is great!!! The ends stay in the DVD and TV. Looks great and the price is right too. I just wish it would have worked right out of the box. It's NIghtwish they always put out amazing stuff. Watching the dvds with the new singer , is simply amwesome. Very new powerful Nightwish. APPLE WORKS AS IT SHOULD\n",
        "APPLE PRODUCT AND SUPPORT ARE BOTH GREAT\n",
        "I NEED TO CATCH UP WITH TECHNOLOGY AND FIGURE OUT ALL ITS FEATURES AND THEM START PUTTING THEM TO GOOD USE This a a pretty straight-ahead review. This speaker wire is a good value for the price paid. As you may know, the heavier the gauge wire, for the most part, is preferred, yet on long runs it can get to be fairly cost-prohibitive. It is really a compromise. This speaker wire does a good job for my purposes. I used it for a home theater setup in the Master Bedroom. I would definitely recommend this case to a friend. It is price-friendly, and offers a variety of colors. I wish it had an opening to allow camera usage while the iPad is in the case. Good control looks very slick in black, smooth over all but to big Nice headphones. A lot louder with the cord than on bluetooth. They feel kinda flimsy. We shall see how well they hold up durability wise. I make personalized cards printed on white card stock. The pictures come out beautifully. I do find it a bit confusing printing double sided sometimes depending on the card configuration. This is my 3rd Canon printer/scanner. Once I figured out the set up, it's quite easy to use. I like it very much. Good price, easy to setup and speed and performance is so far good Just mounted a Sharp 52 inch LCD. This is an ultimately simplistic mount that does a great job. Cute functional and durable case for I pad mini reasonable price I Love My Head Phones! Very Comfy, Even To Sleep With Them On! They Also Last A Very Long Time. purchased for my daughter's laptop without Bluetooth so she could use Bluetooth headphones on the laptop. worked flawlessly with her windows 8 laptop. I've had this computer for a little over a month and so far everything has been great! I replaced an older iMac with this one and everything transferred perfectly. Apple makes the upgrade process so easy. Overall good product, and also got the xbox instead of a ps4 cuz there are certain games that are coming out just for xbox such as Titan fall and halo. The best value flash drive I've ever purchased! Works well, easy to use, lot's of capacity and super inexpensive! Good story, great movie. Mat Damon did a great job. There is a lot of blood. This movie is not for the young. This little mouse is perfect for my laptop. It feels good and works like a charm. It is very responsive and smooth. There is a \"back\" function on the wheel so you do not have to click the back button on the browser. I find that useful. It was very easy to set up.\n",
        "\n",
        "I cannot attest to longevity. Overall, I am very pleased with the mouse. I consider myself an average handy person. This was very easy to follow the directions and install it myself. a nice light e-reader. but the screen is easy to damage. I am start photographer business and I love this printer is fast. Highly recommended by cable technician when he saw the quality over their item. Made a big difference in signal and reception. Very lightweight, easy to forget you have it on. Battery life is fantastic both in use and on standby. Crystal clear sound. With a lifetime guarantee, who would want these measuring cups. simple and effective. Rome is a great show, both seasons. It's about as close as you can get to a big time movie in terms of acting and plot. On blu ray the amazing story is matched in picture and audio quality! A must buy for any historical fiction buff who prefers stories based closely around real stories. This device simplifies the use of the Surface. It also eases the interface with programs used on the Surface. It is important to buy this and become accustomed to using it. We enjoy using the Surface because this device makes it easier to use. I love this movie, so much i had to buy it for my personal collection. Fitbit was very easy to setup and easy to use and keep track of my information. I've already recommended to a co-worker. The invisible shield is a great minimal protection for your iphone. I didn't want to have a bulky otterbox or case for my phone and this invisible shield protector screen does exactly what I need. It protects the screen of your phone from minor scratches without blurring the picture. I hardly even notice it is on the phone. The paper white screen is so easy to read even in sunlight. The size is very portable. You are never without a great book to read. I really like this case it offers a lot of protection for my phone. It would be nice if you could buy the rubber as a replacement. Working in the service industry my case is expose to a lot of oily hands and it's hard on the rubber. Having to buy a complete case when I just need a new rubber cover kinda stinks. Great product though. This purchase was our first Apple computer. Sets up easily. Use of Apple computer is a little different than other computers, but easy to use once you get the hang of where everything is. Programs are downloaded through the app store and there is no use of CD to install programs. Got rid of my smartphone for a dumbphone and plan on using the iPad for everything I needed with a bigger screen. As usual, the iPad being an Apple product is very easy to use. It keeps going and going. I try and use Energizer in all my electronics I think it is a great player. I like that the remote has a \"light\" button so you can see the buttons in the dark. The picture qualify for dvds and bluerays are great. I don't like that the player does not recall the place you left of while viewing the movie. It does recall the place on dvds. It has the important apps like Hulu Plus and Netflix. I also that you only have to barely touch the play, power and eject buttons on the top of the player in order for them to work. It is a really good player especially for the price. I got it as an open-box for a really great price!! had to return the first one, would not charge. but the second one is working great. great for watching Netflix while on the treadmill It serves its purpose or the purpose I bought it for. i like this product. it is modern and very useful. I bought this for my son. He loves it. No wires to get in his way. The film was difficult to put on the screen without any bubbles. Once I finally got it on the screen without bubbles, it was good. This movie was very fun ! I really like the action sequences, kept me entertained the entire time. Great value for the price...easy to see and easy to use..set up was easy to be compatible with your t.v. Christmas present for my son to accompany his PS4. Bought this for my wife, an extremely happy wife means a very lucky husband... Perfect size, weight and cord length. Price is appropriate for product quality. it was for my grandson and he uses it all the time he knows more about it than I do It lasts awhile before changing the Cartridge. It stays good color until the very last print. I really like this ink Cartridge because I love my HP Printer it goes too! I love my printer because it is wireless and I can print from anywhere.... Awesome product I would recommend this product to anyone. I took an old LCD monitor from an old computer I had to make a tv area in my garage. It worked perfectly to go from hdmi to the screen. I waited to buy a Kindle and I am glad I did. This $119 product does everything I could ask it. Who needs an IPad? It cleans the screen very good. You can also use this to clean any screen as cell phones to computers etc.... No complaints I just bought a new WiiU and needed controllers. For the price of one WiiU controller I purchased 2 of these! It's easy to use and very convenient to travel with. Great fun!!! I would recommed it to kids 6 and up. I liked the color options this came in, although some brighter colors would be nice. I like the small size, which is convenient for running, but it is sometimes hard to move on to another song or book while moving. The sound quality is pretty good, and it has long battery life SD cards are great for additional storage and this one works great in. my camcorder This card is great because I can record all my personal videos. I have been an Xbox fan since the original and have loved the gradual changes in the controller. The new version of the controller doesn't disappoint and is probably the most comfortable gaming controller I've ever felt. It seems to fit perfectly in your hand, and the new triggers are fluid and have a cool resistance feature. Easily get back to your home screen pushing the center \"X\" and shake it to ward off zombies as well! Very nice picture and good sound quality. Was extremely easy to hook up to cable and electronics. Smart TV features easy to apply and use. Overall very pleased with the quality and ease of use for the price I love my iPad mini! I'm glad I waited for the second gen. Great size, load with lots of great apps, great colors from screen. Great buy for anyone. Great value for the price and it is durable to lugged all over a college campus by a student on a daily basis. What parent can ask for more when the padding helps protect and expensive item such as a laptop.  Great tablet that is reasonably priced. It is fun to use and does a variety of things. Would recommend to this tablet. We purchased this for our bedroom and it works great! The picture is very clear and not grainy at all even in our large room. This is a nice device if you are looking for flexibility with placement of storage device and being able to connect it to many devices without all the crazy wires. It installed easily but the remote access function is a little confusing on how it works. Overall this is a good device and would recommend to others. Zagg is fantastic, plus has a lifetime warranty! Loves it! My product won't get a lot of use but will be handy for when I need it. Love these for the gym; light weight, clear sound. Works quickly and pretty good indoor tracker. I question the accuracy compared to my treadmill, but I haven't used it in conjuction with GPS tracking yet either. Great Kuerig alternative, especially nice with cool whip on top. We have only had this modem for approximately one month. Thus far is has out performed previous modems we have used. Works great! The fact that the only cases in the store for my son's Nexus Google pad made the purchase very quick and easy. The choice was black or white. It holds the pad nicely and can work as a stand. Very nice portrait lens for a price that's right, compared to Nikon's expensive zoom lenses, like the 24-70 F/2.8, which costs over $1000. With a crop-frame (DX) camera (e.g. D3000 and D5000 series), this effectively gives you 75 mm magnification, excellent for portraits, with a very shallow depth-of-field by virtue of the large maximum aperture. Very fast lens for indoor shots without flash also. Fantastic lens for the price, and so much better than the 18-55 or 55-200 kit lenses! Stunning in design, love the sleek sexy feel. Finger recognition is just cool Excellent printer for price. Very easy to set up, took 5 minutes. If you are looking for a wireless printer that can scan and copy you can't go wrong for the money. Buy it. You won't be sorry. I used to only buy Epson printers but I got this one because of the ability to print on DVD's. I am now a Canon convert. I purchased this for my daughter, who is a senior in high school. She uses it for her AP English papers and expects to be able to use it at college as well. Remote was very simple to setup. A little bit expensive, but worth the money in the long run. Coffee tastes great but the quantity of cups in a box needs to be larger Great tablet that is reasonably priced. It is fun to use and does a variety of things. Would recommend to this tablet. my review would be an \"excellent\" except for the fact that I had to return it 2 times before I got one that worked properly...the on/off button failed both times and unit would not power up after I spent hours setting it all up to my liking...was a real pain. The 3rd one I have now works like a charm and I love it. The color would not have been my first choice but it has an excellent cover and color. Professional and trendy with high function. I would not let my boys, ages 9 and 11, touch our ipad until we bought this. I wanted to keep it safe from scratches and kid dirt, and this definitely fit the bill. Pricier than some of the other cases, but since the ipad was a gift I was ok spending a little more to get the protection I wanted. Even with the problems I have with the volume button, I highly recommend this if you let your kids use your electronics. Love the tablet, it's easy to use and made my life easier. it is a apple and it is white and i like it that way. Perfect size for my surface pro 2. Wasn't easy to find something with quality and didn't cost too much, but this is great! After seeing my friends lose their phones to water damage, I knew I wanted the life proof. It's easy to put on and it tested great. The only thing I don't really like is that the screen protector looks warped, like it's not a good fit. I LOVE that the new style jack cover screw is attached--no more lost jack screws! Great router! Live in a medium sized home with a lot of wireless devices and it works great. Internet is not slow at all, even when 3 computers, smart phones, and Apple TV are hooked up and running. Great little SD card and priced right. Waited for sale since they are usually expensive. I bought this Panamax to plug pretty much everything I have in my entertainment system and it works like a charm. You never really know the power of a great surge protector until you see your energy bill, and those this won't save you millions...it still helps.\n",

        "There really isn't a bad quality with this,and it looks cool as well with the blue lighted display. Great mouse for the average gamer. Lightning is customizable and so is the DPI and buttons. This mouse covers all the bases for me. Watch every episode - and enjoy this show!! It keeps getting better and better!!! My son 8 years old totally Loves this game !His sister who is 12 also Loves to play. We needed a countertop microwave at a good price considering how much we spent for other appliances in our new home.. For much less than $100, this microwave has the size we need without taking up too much counter space. We wanted a microwave to heat up items, not make gourmet dishes. It performs excellent. It heats food in a timely manner, is easy to use and has no surprises. We haven't used a lot of the features, but we weren't really looking for bonus features. It heats as expected and heats well, which is exactly what we were looking for. It is definitely on the quiet side compared to other microwave I have used. I would definitely buy a Sharp microwave again, especially at the size and price point which I paid. Absolutely no complaints after weeks of use. Great replacement for a Nikon lens cap, probably cheaper than a Nikon. I'm very pleased with the Microsoft Xbox system. I've always dealt with sony only. From opening the box until now I've been nothing but satisfied. It blew my kids mind getting it for Christmas. This is one of the best tablet for the price. You get a pure Google experience with this tablet without an overlay of bloatware. I own a Samsung SG4 and love it, but sometimes, touchwiz gets on my nerves. With this tablet, I get the lastest OS update...KitKat! I could've went with an iPad mini w/ retina, but I fancy myself as technically advanced and I don't need a dumbed down product. Plus, I like the customization of Android over iOS. The 7\" is the perfect size to hold with one hand. The screen and color saturation is amazing! The audio with it's surround sound is unparalleled for a tablet this size. Overall, you won't regret your purchase. Used this on our trip to Los Angeles and found it to be most helpful in all of our journeys in and around the city. I love this phone,it does everything I want it to do I really like this light bulb. It makes my bathroom so much brighter. I used gift cards to get the headphones as I always felt the price was too high. I really enjoy the features I expected I would. Great noise cancelling and wonderful sound quality, However the battery life was much shorter than expected. Would be great if you could use the headphone without the noise cancelling feature when it is not needed. My wife loves this iron. She would never change this one for another brand. My daughters love to use it too. needless to say got it for $80. Good smart phone 4 the pice got it for my mom for Christmas. ....would recommend 4 the price. .... Price is equal to one month of cable. Easy to set up. Lots of movies to watch and TV shows. Still have to pay for latest movies. Great choice. Nice to have a remote starter this winter from hell. However this is the third remote in three years. I wish it lasted. I love this tablet for my four-year old. He knows how to fully operate it and it has a separate kids portal that blocks him from accessing unauthorized sites. Definitely recommend this tablet! best race game ever looks and sound real very nive I love this product because makes my pc faster, great !! This is a great tripod for people who travel or who are constantly moving around! Got this for my teen to use (making him pay for half the data plan). So much more reliable than the slider phone he had before. Also, I can give him access to certain features and block others (use the Restrictions under Settings, General, and also make sure you control the Apple ID). As he gets older, we can release more and more control over to him. He is very careful with his devices, but we still got a case for the phone to protect it from accidental incidents. And a screen protector is a must. Very easy to install. easy to get bubbles out. provided squeegee helped immensely. follow written provided directions and you can't go wrong. We've only had the reuter installed for about a month and thus far is out performs the other reuter we have used prior to this one. I have been hesitant to dive into the MAC world, but have the Iphone and Ipad and love those products. The fact that I could syn all of them was very appealing.\n",
        "I am loving learning this system and I know that when I am more comfortable with it I will love it even more. It is so straight forward.\n",
        "Very easy to set up, BUT be aware there is NO DVD drive. I bought this as a back up, since my kids keep taking over my electronics. I know, you may say I shouldn't give up my electronics to my kids, but if you are looking at a Kindle, you understand the value of uninterrupted reading time. Anyway, back to the point, I bought this as a back up to my tablet, and have found myself reaching for this even when I could read from the tablet. It's basic, it's lightweight, and fits in one hand. Sometimes I get a little confused when the touch screen doesn't work... oh wait, it isn't touch screen, that's why I'm confused... but who needs that when all you want is to do is to read a good book? Plus, I don't have to freak out about the potential of losing it, since it is so inexpensive (in the grand scheme of electronics). This is a great case for any medium sized point and shoot! I have had several coffee makers and this is the best by far.\n",
        "I like the fact that the coffee level is indicated on the outside of the machine. The carafe does not drip and is easy to clean, top comes right off. It also does not develop coffee stains as my previous one did.\n",
        "The temperature of the brewed coffee is perfect. I have only had it a short time so I cannot comment on long term durability. The amount of water lost to the grounds is minimal, so if you put in water to the ten cup line you get ten cups out of the machine. I use filtered water and so do not use the carbon filter. I have used both paper and the gold filter without any problem. it was super easy to install and the tv fits perfect It's great I love my XL the screen the color red my favorite easy to handle love it This is the second Logitech mouse we owned and it's just as good as the first one. Awesome product. Cooks good, easy to use, does everything it's supposed to do. Versatility is awesome. Light weight easy to handle. Color is great. Even heating. Good value for the price and as backup cap. Very pleased. I thought it was a little on the expensive side but worth it for the durability and sharp look. I have many of these cards for my cameras (DSLRs and point and shoots) and they are great. I highly recommend the Class 10 cards It is a good quality photo paper and is a great price for the quantity. Also dries very quick and I would buy this product again... I like it. It has good picture quality. The remote is kind of big, otherwise I really like the TV. i like using these gift cards to put money on the goggle play store. This was also an added bonus with my camera purchase. I was happy to have the added memory. my child is 7 years old and she is very excited about her tablet. the available apps are great... Great machine for the money. Excellent suction. Picks up debris with one pass instead of 2 or 3 like other vacuums Ive used. I have returned to using percolators for the last 3 years. I bought them at estate sales and used them until they wore out. I didn't realize how weak my last one was until I plugged this pot in. When I poured my first cup, a rich brown brew flowed into my mug and it smelled heavenly. I added some caramel creamer and enjoyed a truly mellow java experience.\n",
        "If you like hot delicious coffee, buy this percolator. It's a great bargain. This camera was a gift for an elderly person and they loved it! so easy to use for every day pictures. I use this printer so print homework assignments and other documents. so far it has work brilliantly. my only complaint is you have to keep the paper try door open all the time. The double sided printing is a nice feature and replacement ink is not expensive. Set up was a breeze and took very little effort. I have had to fail to print maybe twice but have printed probably 150 pages in that time. I would highly recommend this printer. Wonderful product and complement to the Samsung Tablet 3 10.1 I got it for xbox 1 works in game sound but but no hook up for chat The earphones are very nice. They are a little hard to get used to wearing only because I have never worn earphones before so it's nothing against the earphones...just takes a bit of getting used to. Bought this to keep my coffee cold, works great. Has a good feel in the hand. This is so easy to use and they keep adding more apps of stuff to watch. We just spent an hour looking at home pictures and videos as a family and the kids loved it. I love having the Disney channel, pbs, and espn 3 on it. I will also turn on the music video app and have that play, or steam music from my phone or computer. It works perfect all the time! Good game with enough action to keep my attention. love it enjoy using starter and having door locks . This item turns our older Samsung Smart TV into a newer one..streaming from Netflix &amp; Hulu is a breeze, you can even access Facebook &amp; Twitter! The sales rep forgot to tell us that we also needed an optical cable to be able to hear sound..so we had to buy that too. But after that was installed, we have had no issues- would highly recommend! for the $35 price you can have a smart tv. Watch netflix and web pages wirelessly The fitbit is a great daily tracker and compares to the likes of nike fuel band. The tripod was an added item that I didn't think I would use, but I have several times. This is one of the easiest purchases I ever made. It fit perfectly. Amazing tool to get full use of the tv. Easy and convenient to use. Just what I needed to motivate me. Love ability to \"team\" up. We bought this for our grandson when we bought our granddaughter a Leap Pad. Very easy to use! Wonderful graphics; ease of use and portability. great with optional bluetooth keyboard. Highly recommend. Purchased this as a backup for my laptop and to increase storage. Am pleased with this product. The matched bag carries everything I need. I'm glad to have it. I am very happy with the value of this tablet.\n",
        "However, there is not enough information about how to use some of the\n",
        "aspects. I would like to be able to have instruction in hand. I was having so much trouble getting online and accessing any websites. but with my extender I have not had issues with my system failing or dropping my website. we have 2 desktop and 3 laptops and all get the same reception. I love it. Anyone with a Kindle should have this product. It helps protect your Kindle a n d also folds so you can use the Kindle more conveniently. Good price,good quality.I have tried others and they did not last at all. I purchased this as an Open Box item with an added 10% off. The Polk name brings quality, but they were even better than expected. I would have been very happy paying full price, just lucked out. I paired the with a new Yamaha receiver and a Pioneer subwoofer. I'm thinking about getting another pair for replacing my older surround sound speakers. Bought this to replace a defunct secondary projector in a church: permanent mount, inverted (bottom-up), front projection. I had checked the specs on Epson's site before purchase, so I knew that the image size would be correct for the throw distance. (Kudos to Epson.com for their excellent Throw Distance Calculator web app.)\n",
        "\n",
        "We had to fabricate an adapter to attach the \"universal\" mounts on the projector to the holes on the existing \"universal\" bracket, but that was OK.\n",
        "\n",
        "Image quality is superb and super-bright in a well-lit room, and the fan is very quiet. Great compact projector, esp. for its price point.\n",
        "\n",
        "The only problem was with the image settings. We adjusted the inversion, zoom and keystone when we installed it, then shut it off. When it was turned back on a few days later, it lost all of those settings. Fixed them again, and it forgot them again on the next power-off.\n",
        "\n",
        "There is no menu option to save settings as default. It made no sense that a projector that's designed for fixed installation couldn't retain its geometry settings.\n",
        "\n",
        "Eventually, we figured out that we had to turn off \"Auto setup\" on the Image menu, which is on by default. The manual describes this as \"Automatically optimizes computer image quality (when On),\" with no further explanation. \"Automatically makes bizarre and random geometry changes\" would be more accurate.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once we turned that off, it worked perfectly. Settings now are retained across sessions. -1 usability point for mediocre docs. Everything else about it is great. Love my new nexus tablet. It has 32 GB which will give me plenty of space. The size is terrific and the graphics are spectacular. It runs super fast and easy to operate. I would recommend this for anyone looking for a new tablet. I got it and immediately impressed by its quality, easy of use, everything... I recommended to my other family members and they purchased for themselves as well. We all love it. So from now on, we'll say apple products are very good, if not the best. The Lifeproof is still my favorite waterproof case, although it's not perfect. You should be aware that there are plenty Lifeproof knock-off cases floating around and they should be avoided (many look a lot of like a real Lifeproof case, but they end up not being waterproof). very good value for the price. it is a one time purchase that keep its value by giving a record of activity and no monthly charge. It was very easy to set up and it works great with our laptops, tablets, and smartphones. I liked slim design larger screen ability to change things when I want wasn't too hard to set up just takes awhile for some of the personalization  Just amazing, a lot of fun and great fight and of course my favorite a lot of blood !!! Good picture and sound and easy to set up. I haven't yet been able to reprogram so I can turn on and off with only one remote, instead of using both the cable company remote as well as the Samsung remote. I like having a wireless mouse it works great just don't know why I have to keep plugging and unplugging it every time I turn on my computer for it to work Great product at a great price working fine no problems. Make no mistake this is a difficult game. Do not buy this for your 7 year old, they will just end up frustrated. This is a hard game and it's artfully created. The soundtrack is one of the best in years. I planed on getting one as soon as the replacement for the 360 was announced and plan to keep it for years to come\n",
        "Then pass it down to my nieces kids Everything about this game is great.! The NBA 2 K games get better every year. There is minimal changes needed but I know they will happen within the next year or two. Great price and easy hookup. Gives great picture quality! I am 5'0 and this chair is the perfect size for me. I would probably not recommend it if you are very tall, because even at the tallest height adjustment it is not very tall. It is relatively compact for the amount of cushion it provides. Even after sitting for a few hours it is comfortable. This CD has all the great songs from the movie and all the instrumental pieces as well! After years of bad Mortal Kombat games, this reboot may be better than any of the previous games in the series. The single player story mode is epic, spanning the first three games, and is a blast to play thru. Local multiplayer is also great.\n",
        "\n",
        "The only downside to this game, is the online multiplayer tends to occasionally suffer from network lag or input lag.\n",

        "I picked up this copy for a friend. I originally purchased the game and bought the DLC seperately. $19.99 or less is an absolute steal for the season pass characters and skins to be included. Buy it! I love energizer batteries. they never seem to corrode like Rayovac ones do. WAS A DECENT MOVIE. GOOD VISUAL EFFECTS . THE 3D WAS NOT TO BAD ON THIS MOVIE very good product. If you need something to print really fast then this is the best product. I LOVE THIS PHONE. EASY TO USE, GREAT APPS, PERFECT SIZE, MUSIC SOUNDS GREAT, PICTURES LOOK AMAZING, LIGHTWEIGHT, AND IT LOOKS GREAT, VERY STYLISH This case fits my Chromebook, charger, and has room for more. I also like that it has padding to protect its contents. It is not a giant case- which is what I wanted. It is easy to carry with me anywhere. It would be a better product if it were waterproof and slightly bigger to accommodate 8x11 paper. All in all a great product. It's a great refrigerator to store extra food, water and sodas.\n",
        "An additional freezer is always helpful as well.\n",
        "It was on sale and fit into our limited space. I just got my iPhone 5s. I wanted to spend a little of extra money to protect it. The case is super light. It doesn't make the phone cumbersome like other cases I've seen. The finger print scanner works about 50% of the time. So, compared to the other cases that don't work at all... I thought this was better than 0%. Calls are very clear and not muffled. Speaker phone and music sound ok. It uses the window on the back as a speaker. The bad part is the adapter for the headphone adapter. That is annoying!! All in all an expensive quality case. I purchased this camera to use during training classes for work. We take pictures of each new student and upload them to our database. It was easy to install, takes clear pictures, and I haven't had any problems with it. I haven't used it for videos, but as far as pictures go it's a keeper. I like the way it fits. It is easy to use and easy to clean. Purchased for a Tablet. Small size with memory needed. Easy installation. No problems. I had fried my 80gB when the dry winter weather enabled me to jump an arc to it. The 160gB easily and quickly was loaded with my media. The battery life is good enough to have music for a 10 hour road trip with little indicated battery use. All of the old familiar features are still present. This is the second Call of Duty game I've played (I know, I'm not a serial gamer, very much a casual player). I hated the first one because I felt like it was wayyyyyy too confusing (in single player mode).\n",
        "\n",
        "This game seems to have dialed it down, and is excellent in single player mode. It really shines in online play though.\n",

        "You won't be disappointed. I hope. This printer has been a dream come true. The wireless feature doesn't clutter up my desk &amp; the copies are nice and clear. this game is an awesome game. as a walking dead fan (and sniper with p.t.s.d.) my grandmother got me this game to help me learn to relax. i was skeptical at first, but as i began to play; i found myself engulfed by the plot line and the game tailoring itself around my responses. this game was fairly true to BOTH the walking dead series and graphic novels, while offering some new character twists. As for the game itself it has helped me to relax and to also get sleep; while taxing my thought process and decision making ability. you cannot go wrong with this game: and when i finish it i will be buying season 2. The screen doesn't show the actual scan that you've done and so far I have no complaints , it's a great simple fax, copier. Felt like I was traveling with the characters, experiencing all the same trials that they were. If you need a charger, I would choose this one again. They are the typical energizer batteries. I would rather pay for name brand batteries and know they are dependable. As the bunny says, they keep going and going and going... Overall I'm happy with this purchase. It has multiple outlets and I especially like the usb ports to charge my phone or other devices. The only complaint I have is that it is not centered around the wall outlet so it is kind of top heavy and tends to lean away from the wall instead of feeling securely in place against the wall. This flash drive is very easy to use, like most drives. Push it open, pop it in the USB port, and get going. For the capacity, the price on this flash drive was beyond worth it. I purchased this drive for my car. It has a USB port for charging and hooking up phone/iPod/whatever else, but I just stuck the drive in the port. Accesses the songs a lot more quickly than the CD player and instead of hooking/unhooking an MP3 player after every ride, I simply leave the drive in the port. 8gb seems to be more than enough, at least for now. If you're on the fence about purchasing, jump over and pick one up...definitely worth it. Movie was overall great. Love how they keep giving more of these legendary Marvel characters, even if the whole world does not know them that well. Thor is one the first iconic characters that Stan Lee made into a comic god (pun intended). Seeing him on the silver screen just made it better and I'm glad I get to see them in my life time before I'm to old to enjoy it. I've been reading Thor and all the Avengers since I was about 8 or 9 years old and almost 30 years later I see in live action. It's an amazing thing for a comic nerd like me. My only complain about the movie, if any is that they did not give Mr. Christopher Eccleston more proper screen time. You can't even really tell it's him and he's such a great actor and to be given such a small role was befitting to him. He was Dr. Who and Destro after all lol. Besides that the movie was great. Cant wait to see Avengers 2 and Thor 3 needed a second landline, price was right and good brand name It was a really good movie and watched many times/ If you want to laugh your pants off, this movie will not disappoint I was reluctant to jump to the \"next generation\" gaming consoles, but after about 30 minutes of playing, I knew it was the right call. Graphics will blow your mind. I'm a big fan. just bought this a few months ago and is working fine for me have not had any problems with it. Looks and feels like it is a quality part. Go buy it if you like to dance and party. It is well worth it! What an excellent deal this is, getting two classic 70's films for one low price, and on Blu-Ray! The movies look great, sound great and still are fun to watch when you need that 70's film groove. This screen protector is good in the sense that it of course protects the screen and resists very well the fingerprints or smudges which would reduce the touchscreen recognition, so for every day use it is excellent great sound good headphones great for training and running Price was a little high, but you get what you pay for. I love my playstation 4 because of all the great features it has including it functioning as a Blu Ray player as well as a high def video console. I can't get enough of it. awesome album from this young and talented girl, looking forward to many more. Great voice! Overall, I am very pleased with the performance. I would recommend it to anyone! Loved it! Was very excited to watch this movie! It's a must see! It works great to protect against shock damage...I wish the color was closer to the actual color of the iPod.. durable battery good for remote and other tools good for cameras The Duck Dynasty 3 pack is a great bargain on Blu-Ray. You get all the fun moments from the first three seasons in one cool set. No need to spend a lot of money on three individual sets. The show, in my opinion, is worth watching over and over again, and this Blu-Ray set makes it easy to do. I purchased this keyboard for someone at my office. It's exactly what she wanted and said it works great. Who wouldn't like wireless? The cords on regular keyboards always seem to get in the way. i actually got this for my grandson (who has p.t.s.d.) and doesn't sleep much. His doctors wanted him to play \"strategic and mind taxing games\" for him to be able to sleep; so he went out and bought a 360 slim used at a used game store. as a result, i bought him this controller to go with it, and \"The Walking Dead Season 1\" video game. He fell in love with this controller, as he could convert it to a positive controller for the \"x Y axis\" and has used it heavily. He taught me how to convert the \"x Y axis\" to a\n",
        "\"scroll wheel\" configuration to use for navigating dvd menu's when he's not here. I must say that it is easy to convert to a \"scroll wheel\" configuration and it's camouflage design makes me feel very patriotic when using it. I could definitely recommend this to anyone, especially if you want to feel good about what the men and women in the Armed Forces do to protect our nation. So far am real please with the Dual Shock 4 it's a big improvement from the last one feels a little lighter and groves nice to the hand. And with the built in features who would not like it. The only thing that bothers me at times is the light color it shows on the front of Control during use it's a little getting use to from the last controller. I got this laptop to use daily in my graduate program, so it had to be light yet hold up for being a day-to-day work horse and after a month of use it has not dissapointed. It has a great sturdy build and I love the texturized rubber on the keyboard, I'm not a big fan of the aluminum type that Apple has made so popular. I initially thought of the swinging hinge to fold up like a tablet as a gimmicky thing and I bought it for the ultrabook type construction, component quality, price and keyboard but I have surprised myself by how often I do use it in tablet mode, tent mode etc. It's great for reading pdfs, editing, note taking or watching video. It is a wonderful, powerful machine and I have been very pleased with my purchase. As a side note, I have noticed on a few occasions the color yellow a bit wonky like some have said. I have not downloaded the bios update I that I hear can fix it simply because it doesn't bother me enough and school keeps me too busy to worry about it great sound and great design. working perfect with my tv This game for the wii is so much fun and it is great for family night! THIS HAS GOT TO BE ONE OF THE BEST COFFEE MAKERS. THIS IS A HIT AT WORK!! CO-WORKER WENT AND BROUGHT ONE. A friend of mine had seen the movie in 3D in the theater, and he said it made the movie much more realistic, so I had to try it this time. He was right! Quicken has always been a good product, but now it is even better. It makes it easier to link to all of your financial institutions, such as banks, credit cards, stock brokers, etc. It does take time to get it set up, but once completed it is definitely useful in planning and executing a budget, making payments, collecting tax data and forecasting financial future. Overall, great financial program! The light does what it is supposed to do. I like low-watt, and this delivers with an Instant-on that fluorescent bulbs can't. The color temperature is pretty similar to conventional, too. The LEDs are supposed to last for 15 years or something but the build quality isn't fantastic. Good price, though. Love it and so does my son. My son has a disability and this device is accommodating. The movie isvgreat Woody allen is genuis. Dice clay is great overall great movie enjoy it. My last Yamaha amp was over 15yrs old and still work awesome, the reason of changing this one is update my system with HMDI switching.\n",
        "Like Yamaha product they never fail on me I like eureka products. I tried the Hoover wind tunnel and had to return it the next day. It made a awful whistling noise, but not the Eureka. It was working straight out of the box. Very powerful suction!, nice attachments send tools. Easy to empty. Just heavy to lift to carry to multiple floors in my homr overall pretty good album. Picked it up after the Grammy's and was not disappointed. Worth the buy. after much research for a first smart phone, this was the one I found to be highly recommended. Primarily wanted a pocket friendly size with a decent camera, good video, and very durable as well. has lived up to everything I wanted and more. only drawback would be no removable memory, but easy to move to my computer and haven't had to erase anything yet. still have like 3/4 memory available. battery life so far good for at least a day, but I'm not on it all day long like some users. Easy to use and provides me with a good everyday external drive. Bought this for my son for his birthday. He just purchased a 47\" LG TV. His room was not large enough for, nor did he want an expensive 5.1 system. This speaker was perfect for what he wanted. The sound quality was really good for a sound bar of this price point. The wireless sub woofer worked great and really added some punch to the sound. All in all I'm very pleased with this product. The dialogue of the movie was very dry. I wish George Clooney had not\n",
        "died in the movie. Bogus that the audio attachment is not compatible with my old headphones Great looking charger. And vey functional. Controllers snap on and off with ease. Good story, filled with little bits of humor. A little slow at points but overall a very good movie. Bought this for my wife for a new iPod Touch. She loves it! She used to have an Otterbox that literally cracked in half, but with the plastic skeleton covered here, it seems like it will be a lot sturdier. Controller works great, plus in Luigi colors. Green is my favorite. This is the second Zagg Folio case we've had. The first one was for the iPad 2, and was good except the USB charging port broke easily and it was a challenge to charge. THIS ONE for the iPad Mini with Retina, however has been fantastic! Multi-colored backlit keys, and the charging port is a bit more accessible and sturdy. Definitely recommend. Bought this cover for my 4th grader and he loves it. Works well with his tablet. Its his favorite color. This Sanus wall mount is by very sturdy and did not take long to install. Got the game on sale and my kids and I have enjoyed playing it. I never was a fan of DC characters (Marvel guy since I was a kid) but they depicted the characters very modernly and tough. Even the often maligned Aqua Man looks great and is one of my favorite characters to play. Definitely and entertaining game and I am not sure if I will ever be able to master ALL of the players. Played with 8 y.o. daughter and we had a blast. She loves to finish the courses (we finished all together) and loves to play with Toad - fun times; but i love to get all stars and stamps. Good time was had by all. Great game, best on WiiU. ITS WORTH SPENDING THE EXTRA MONEY FOR CABLES. DONT GO FOR THE CHEAP CABLES TO SAVE MONEY. This item will exceed your demands while remaining affordable. I have a moderate hearing loss due to my age. As a result i hear some frequencies perfectly and others i can't here at all without cranking up the t.v. My grandson who takes care of me has a mild hearing loss from being in combat; as a result turning up the t.v. or surround sound (at least real loud) hurt HIS ears. As a result i started looking for good quality speakers to go with my new yamaha receiver, as a result this is one of the pairs my grandson recommended for my hearing loss because they had exceptional response on the frequencies i needed. to be sure these would be right, he bout me one pair to go behind the chairs (at least to try) and they sounded great, and i noticed i could hear better without turning it up as loud. then he bought me a set for the front of my system, and now i hear perfectly with these two sets and my subwoofer. i no longer need to turn the t.v. up loud and hurt my grandson's hearing (at least what is left of his hearing) while being able to hear clearly myself. I'm glad he got me these speakers and subwoofer, and i cannot wait until he replaces my center speaker. i would definitely recommend these to anyone with hearing loss needing a speaker with a WIDE range of frequency response. For the price of this hard drive you get great quality, it is fast and easy to install in any desktop computer Attractive design , Easy to set up and great price.\n",

It\u2019s a good router for a casual user but if you\u2019re doing cumbersome tasks on the internet and or at a distance more than about 25 feet from the access point this router straggles to keep up. Otherwise it\u2019s a great value. Has lifetime warranty which makes it great for casual internet usage. The sound is great! Looks better than picture.

Loved the original, this one is better. Updated graphics, use of WiiU controller a plus. If you loved the original, or just a Zelda fan, do not pass this up. I was not to sure at first if i like this TV but once I got this TV home and set it up I really like it. The picture is nice and works great with my Xbox games. I have not seen any shadowing on my sports games. The sound took some getting use to for me because our old TV was 10 years old and the sound has change in all TV's since then. So if you are trying to make up your mind this TV it is worth its price. A really funny movie, good laughs and ideas. My own grandpa laughed. Great cable, fast speeds, plenty of length. Can reach long or close this is the cable to have. My mom likes the phone and that's what counts. The phone is sleek and looks good. The white color makes it easy to find. No complaints so far. I have had this phone for about 1 month. My previous phone was the HTC rhyme. The battery on the moto g lasts at least twice as long and I can actually hear what people are saying. I love that it updated with the newest version of android. My only complaint is that I have to conserve memory. I have never had a phone that I couldn't add memory to. I probably would have been willing to pay more 16g or a micro SD slot. Love this case. It has an easy docking station. Beautiful colors. Great for slipping into your pocket doesnt stick or slide. Non stick rubber around the edges. Great outer protective case. A little right if you have your iPad Mini tucked inside a Zagg Folio for iPad Mini. Works well most of the time, loses connection periodically but we like it Wiimote Plus Review, great little controller in the style of Mario. I seem to be running out of ink all the time. It would be nice if there were options to get a 2x size cartridge. They claim this is a XL cartridge, but it is the same physical size as the regular one. Does that mean the regular one is only half full?? Perhaps the low mark for the past 3 movies, this still entertains far more than anything lately. Likable characters who seem to genuinely like each other is the draw for this ensemble piece. The focus for the last few movies on 'Ocean 11' type heists has changed the franchise for the better.\n",
        "This movie is loud, brash and not extremely bright, but it is far from mindless fun.\n",
        "Waiting for the next two (or three) to come out. I really appreciate the improvement in speed vs. my old Roku XD's. Also like the new user interface and closed-captioning. However, I dislike the design of the new remote control, which instead of integrating the select button between the cursor keys, has a separate button below. Also, they need to include back-lit or glow-in the dark keys, so that it's easier to use at night. Good mirror compared to its peers. Expensive for not being perfect. I like the computer charge method rather than batteries but the sensor light does not stay on long enough to complete mascara on one eye. Also fogs up very easily. I'd recommend this. The price was excellent and its very fast, much faster than the previous kindle fire. The mayday button is a nice touch although so far i haven't had to use it. Its easy to set up and you can use the mayday button if you do have any trouble. Also, the sound is great for music, movies etc. Overall, a great buy!! I needed something simple to use, lightweight, able to suck the heck out of pet hair on my hardwood floors and was bagless. It has a HEPA filter of sorts that seems to work well. Lots of plastic but that's okay, it makes it easier to pick up and move around/carry. I like the cord button too.\n",

        "I'd buy it again.  This convection oven is fantastic. Cuts cooking time and is so easy to use, If you are looking for a mouse that is wireless, easy to use, and compact then this is it. This mouse is great for traveling, but is not too small for everyday use. I liked it so much I got one for my work laptop. Works great with all my devices iPod 3gen, iPhone 4, MacBook Pro. I highly recommend. Actioned packed from start to finish, I would recommend watching in 3D I needed a phone case for my samsung s3 cellular phone and this works good. It is protecting my cellular phone well. My daughter loves Carly Rae and One Direction , easy songs to sing along with I think I actually type faster on this keyboard than I do my full keyboard at work and on my PC. It's amazing responsive. I will say that I wish Microsoft would make the back out of something that felt a bit sturdier (like leather or faux leather). I'm always conscious of how I put it in my backpack out of fear that I'll fray the edges. We'll see how it stands up over time, but right now, I'm very happy! compared to my laptop it is more convienent and easy to use works well with no problems. Have had one month since switching from phone company DSL to cable internet. Will pay for itself in less than a year by not having to pay the cable company's monthly rental fee for a modem. I did have to 'restart' the modem once to get internet access; not sure why but it's been fine since. Modem is bit on the expensive side but good product with fast connection Quentin's previous films are tamed compared to this entry. Much more violent, a lot longer and very dialogue heavy. Great acting by everyone. These stands worked out great for me. I've always mounted my front speakers but in our new home we couldn't with the way the tv is set up. These stands do a great job. They are very well built and they come with many, many mounting options. I'm really happy with them. Good bundled system. Console is HD upgrade from Wii and can play your old Wii titles.

See it if you like movies about capturing terrorists My toddler thought this was great and sat through the whole thing. He can't stop talking about it! Fun, exciting movie with great characters. I have had one of these for quite awhile so I bought another. No problems with the old one but needed another. These are reasonable priced and never had issues with them yet.. as soon I put it in the computer and ran the disk, it started working with no kinks and have had no issues since. Would recommend to anyone. it does what its made to and is very easy to install with average price these batteries work great and last longer than the cheap Ebay knock offs I bought before.the price wasn't as bad as I had thought either. Great character, was able to unlock the Pirates of Caribbean world. Better than the initial reviews like ign gave. Better than dishonored I traded in my iPad Mini for a Surface tablet after I destroyed my iPhone (and I need all my devices to talk to one another). I had previously owned two iPads. I am sooo glad I made the switch. The surface tablet has made me so much more productive; no more reformatting documents saved in Pages to look right in Word (and the same thing goes for Numbers documents working properly in Excel). Contrary to popular opinion, I find Windows 8 easier to use that iOS 7. Windows 8 is really a combination of iOS7 and Android - stable and easy to navigate like iOS7, but you can customize it like Android. The screen is beautiful and the full keyboard makes it the perfect companion for work and home. As for the lack of apps, I'll say this: my Surface has a much higher percentage of USEFUL apps on it than my iPads ever did. The sound quality is far and away better than that of any iPads I've owned. Yes, there is a lot fewer junk apps available, which is fine with me! The only one possible negative is the size -- this thing is big (not heavy, but awkward to hold -- it's a good thing it has a built in stand!) My eight year old daughter loves the songs and the music !! Apple always makes easy to use products, the thing that I don't like is the remote. It's pretty small. Easy to misplace. You can use your iPhone or iPad as a remote and that's what I usually end up doing. Season 4 is of course a must in the series if you have seasons 1-3. I didn't think it was as drama filled and suspenseful and prior seasons were but still a worth while season to get. The blue ray transfer was just fine as expected. No problems. I bought these for my 8 yr old son, who is a wild man. These are a great price and work incredibly well. I don't have to worry about if he were to break them or loose them, (which he is prone to do at this age) compared to if I would have bought him a more expensive brand like beats. Laughed hysterically in the theater and even more during the second viewing on this blu ray. The extras are awesome as well, cool to see how all the stunts were set up. Great little flash drives. Nice to have different colors available to identify information type stored on each. This mouse is easy to set up, and provides a lot of nice features. The scrolling is very smooth, and I like the \"view all windows\" button. I really like this controller.It holds up very well.Im pretty hard on controllers.have had a lot ,but this brand is great. I was expecting to be visually stunned by the enhancements over the DVD, and honestly, could not see any improvement. Purchased the watch for a couple of reasons; I just upgraded phones and I figured the watch would be a \"cool\" way to stay in touch during meetings.\n",
        "However, it's more of a novelty item than a tool.\n",
        "If you just want a new high-tech toy to expand your mobile reach, then this is definitely for you!\n",
        "This watch is a great ice-breaker; people can't help but to ask about it all the time. So for a social setting, it helps create conversation with new people.\n",
        "As for a business setting; unless you don't mind using voice-commands in front of your colleges or customers, then a \"silent\" phone will do the trick just fine. This 2nd Thor is a great movie, really going to keep marvel going, from one move to the next bringing them all together, from Iron Man, Avengers, Captain America, its a great plot and you got to see them all to keep up and understand what's going on. cant wait for the next. Really so impressed with the special visual and sound effects in this movie.. Great Job Very easy to use. Works great. Very reliable and very durable. Excellent product.

Apple TV is a great way to use your apple account for streaming music and using apps such as HBO GO. I wish they had Pandora as an option but they do have Apple Radio. Very easy to use. I can only recommend this alpine amplifier. Its clean crisp and great quality. I was looking at either JL or alpine. Thank god i went with alpine. Easy installation user friendly controlls. It pushes every bit it can as much as ur subwoofer or speakers can take. Energy efficient and it wont drain your battery. If you only have subwoofers then this class-d amp by alpine is the way to go! I got this game for my five year old because it was highly recommended. We were looking for something that has multiple players and suitable for all ages. This game is really fun but can be hard to pass when getting to a certain level. My son loves it and has not played anything since he got it. I've watched this movie several times since purchasing it. Wolverine is such a great character. This movie was really well made. It was a cool addition to the Wolverine story. This monitor provides a nice display, and is very reasonably priced. This is one of my grandsons favorite movies. He likes most dreamworks movies especially the ice age series. Its a good movie for family night as we adults like it too. I bought this sound link to replace a $50 sharper image Bluetooth device my girlfriend had bought me. The sound on the Bose is leaps and bounds ahead of the sharper image device, but the range on the Bose is pathetic. It's distorted at 25 ft away from my phone while the sharper image will play even if my phone is outside. Disappointed by that, but love the sound quality. Tamar Braxton has a beautiful voice. Her songs are great from the beginning to the end. As a collector of all major WWE PPV events, this blu ray is a must have! Recommended for any WWE fan and especially members of the YES movement! YES! YES! YES! I bought this after owning a Kindle with keyboard for years. Had it not been for my clumsy self I would still be using it as I had no complaints. After looking around to replace the one I destroyed, I decided on the Kindle Paperwhite. I really like the light for night reading but do be aware if use to the older version this will be using a lot more battery than you r used to. I didn't think I would have any problems going to a touch screen but it is not as streamlined as the past versions. Overall, to pages look great and it is easy to read on. Comes with everything you need to charge two controllers: A base charger for two controllers, two rechargeable batteries for two controllers, and battery compartment cover.\n",
        "It does feel a bit flimsy, but it's not like you're going to be banging or dropping this thing off a table or anything. You just put the controllers on the dock when you need to charge it.\n",
        "Very handy if you have two controllers. This was a really entertaining movie! Great humor, action and mystery. Oscar worthy movie worth collecting. It captivated my son and peaked his interest in space. I love the way it protects my MacBook at all time. It's nice bag with sufficient space for mac book and ipad It awsome and inexpensive for my cell phone I had already bought 2 for my camera instead of havering a lot of small gig I just transford all to one My sons absolutely love this game. The lego games are all made so well. They're challenging for the kids but not to the point that it's no fun. It's a smaller version, but big enough. Very easy to carry around, even in your purse.\n",

        "Convenient Such an awesome family movie. There is so much meaning behind this movie. A single dad doing whats best for his family. Better story line. Engaging. Always nice to watch Thor just doing nothing! Fits great! I use them with my iPhone to run, clear sound. A bit pricey, BUT, you get what you pay for. It's simple to use, syncs easily, great screen resolution, and it just feels good. This is a great movie for the entire family. Regardless of age you are sure to find humor and enjoyment with this movie. My kids love this game! It's fun to watch them enjoy dancing and singing along to some of their favorite songs. The provide an inexpensive set of home speakers with good sound quality and a different look from traditional box speakers. I just wanted decent sound without having to kick a subwoofer and these have worked admirably. I bought this game for my wife and she plays it all the time and lets you get a good workout. This is a great antenna! I love it! It is flexible. You can adjust it and move it the way you want, the direction you want. It catches many channels surprisingly. I am so happy I bought it. I was afraid this picture would not hold up on the \"small screen\" but it did. I was on the edge of my recliner just as I was at the edge of my seat at the theater. To think this wasn't actually shot in outer space seems impossible. The camera angles capture the intensity of the situation. I love this movie! I bought this cd because it was an earlier Three Doors Down cd.. I found four different songs I wanted to learn so I could sing them at a Karaoke club/ bar... I found the songs had a good beat and a story that would be easy to sing to\u2026 I have the other 3 Three Doors Down cds. But this was at a great price so I picked this one up also. I so enjoyed watching this with the girls and my husband. We are members of San Diego Zoo and Safari Park; which is very close to the Actual zoo in this movie. I was very touched by the intimacy with the elder tiger and his eventual demise. Great portrayal acting. Great battery life. Bright sharp screen. Fast processor. Bought the HDMI cable to view home videos from my laptop onto the TV. Worked great! The 3D is breathtaking. I do not watch much 3D but this one blew me away. Worth the extra $5.00. It will be watched multiple times. You know the movie. The 3D makes the difference. Also, four different formats, pretty convenient. like everything about this stand except only came with only set of magnets for the doors. But I have a home depot within 2 blocks so easy fix. Essentially, it's a smaller version if the iPad. It works well, the size is the selling factor and if that's what you're looking for then that's what you should get The CD\\DVD reader &amp; writer installed quickly and it came with the right cable. Works just fine. Price was OK. This is a product that I have been waiting for, it is slim in appearance looks good, easy to use Yes Bose is proud of their product as indicated by price. They are likely priced higher than they should be, but that doesn\u2019t stop me from buying. This headset is no exception. I hate in ear buds so have been looking for an over the ear wireless Bluetooth enabled headset that not only plays music, but takes phone calls as well. This fits the Bill.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sound quality is better than good but not the best (Haven\u2019t found a wireless that matches up to wires yet.) This headset ranks at the top of wireless for sound quality. Good Midrange and trebles, Bass is a little soft and mushy, but acceptable (Certainly not bad) I am 50 so take my diminished hearing capacity into account with these comments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bluetooth works well when battery is strong. When it gets weak (After about 6-8 hours of use) you can start to hear drop outs and clicking. Easy sync and switch between multiple devices. I am always switching between my iPhone, Ipad, Mac and Windows laptop. It maintains sync with 2 devices simultaneously (or so it seems). A pretty cool feature as I can be watching movie on my mac, and still hear and pick up calls on my phone.\n",
        "\n",
        "Comfort and ergonomics are also to be commended. Very comfortable wear even with all day use. I just spent the week traveling with the headphones on continuously. Almost forgot they were there. I have tried Plantronics and LG Tones and while I don\u2019t like the in ear buds(Comfort issue); I DO like how you can hang them around your neck when not in use. The drawback to the Bose is they don\u2019t hang around the neck too easily or comfortably. I ended up leaving them on my head and while comfortable, not very practical. I found one wear position where I extend the headband to full length, put the right ear cup over the right ear and rest the left ear cup on my left check. This puts the microphone right at my mouth for better reception, and leaves one ear open to listen to the world around me. It just looks ridiculous.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ergonomically the controls are well laid out on the mic and Bluetooth receiver. Most of the functions are controlled from the main button on top. This is a big square button that is very easy to reach and manipulate. Volume buttons are on the side, well separated and a good size. No more fumbling around with itty bitty buttons you can\u2019t see or feel with large fingers and accidentally pressing the wrong ones\n",
        ".\n",
        "I wish they would have included a hard case and not the cloth bag. Ear padding got all squished first time I put them in my flight bag. Next day I spent another 40 bucks on a hard case. Not happy about that.\n",
        "\n",
        "I call these ALMOST perfect as they would have been perfect if they had attached the bluetooth adaptor to the QE15s instead of the AE2s. Sigh\u2026. This watch is fun. Easy set up and pairing with my iPhone 5. Long battery life. Alarm vibrates on wrist to wake you without bothering anyone else. Apps not plentiful but list is growing. Found a site online where I can design my own watch faces (free) and upload them to my watch. Can only load eight watch faces/apps at a time but can \"garage\" many more on your Pepple iPhone app and switch them out easily. Great Special Effects. Definitely would recommend to everyone Great family movie. The fight between a prince and a city, and how he goes through so much to stand behind what he knows is right. The graphics a good as well. Thor The Dark World is a great addition to Marvel's constantly expanding cinematic universe, with superb reprised acting, gorgeous cinematography and artistic direction, especially in the expansion of the film universe. The deleted scenes are NOT to be missed, and frankly do the film a disservice sitting on the cutting room floor. its better than other headphones but everything apple is perfection It just the best it's great everything you need number one Had this for a month so far. Compared to the 52\" Toshiba it replaced, this is a shiny \"Cadillac\"!\n",
        "It wasn't the easiest to set up with our surround sound and satellite system, and I still haven't been able to make my Starkey hearing aid remote audio device connect.\n",
        "Otherwise thie 60 inch tv is Sharp in MORE than name only.\n",
        "I would recommend it happily. We love our sound system. It makes it feel like you are watching a movie in the theater!! It was good to get a blu ray for such a low cost. I will continue to buy DVDs here From the start the suspense keeps you interest. The acting is the best as well as the special effects. This is a keeper Great product that provides protection for iPad air and includes a blue tooth keyboard. Kids love live and mom loves it when it's on sale for $39.99! Great external hard drive for you everyday user. I use it on both Mac and PC. Daughter loves it and sings along to it all day long. she wants the movie when it comes out It's fast great and I've had no problems. Love it 2 death Good, not bad. light. Speaker is okay. Small and convenient in size. This is great! if I see my batteries running low, I can just plug this into the top of the controller for minimal time loss. Also, one who plays a lot may use many batteries. As for myself, I never used many batteries, but this is easier than making sure you have batteries and what not. You know you're covered, battery life wise. Only downside is that when plugged in to the charger, it interferes with the clearness in your microphone if you play online. Not a big deal, just sort of a nuisance for you and your friends to listen to whenever you speak. MY CAMERA SEEMS TO WORK BETTER USING THIS SD CARD. Great game hours of fun! Kids love the series. Excellent graphics! I got this in one of DOD for around $29. Good value and nice sound. I love this card because I need a lot of space for all my music. This is great product to have good sound quality to come out of blue ray player. Probably wouldn't watch more than once. Maybe it's tradable. Really loved this game. Hadn't played Timb Raider series in a long while. Laura is better than ever. Great game play and the graphics are amazing Great sound. Could be more comfortable for price.\n",
        "The 7.1 surround sound is the best quality I have heard in earphones.\n",
        "The additional software is fun and amusing I bought this cd because it was an award winner this year and I liked the beats of the Cd\u2026 I was also surprised who was involved in the making of this cd. I added it to my I-tunes play and onto my dance play list.. I would also suggest this to my friends. It is useful to type on word processor or to create emails. I use it fore school. I like that it comes with a case, has bluetooth and that you can recharge it (no batteries needed).  Good phone, great features and I still needed a land line so this was a pretty good choice. This is my first MacBook, it is a great notebook and it is easy to use. I always compared product between Apple and Samsung, since I bought this MacBook, I thought apple is really in the top, I expect MacBook will have touch screen! They fit my ear have a very good sound also they are very bulky. I would recommend them I needed a micro sdhc for my laptop and wanted to get enough memory but not too much or too expensive. this is just right. This cover is very professional in looks and provides a great coverage. This game is great coming from a guy who hasn't played battlefield before now I'm glad i made the purchase. This K-cup offers a taste of Kahlua without the alcohol in my coffee. Has a great taste! I am a sucker for Marvel movies, usually see them all, and then buy them when they come out on DVD, regardless of whether they're that great or not. In this case, Thor 'The Dark World' was a great movie and I'm glad I get to rewatch it whenever I want, can't wait for the next Marvel movie! My 1 year old son loves it. Sits and watches the whole thing. The controller has a very high class, stylish look. Works without any problems. Satisfied with my purchase. I enjoy listening to the entire cd. I would recommend to a friend. The phone is intuitive and easy to use. the color is great and the 4g works very good. The signal is weak where I live, very close to town and cell phone office. I don't have a choice. My printer won't print because one of the color is out. I did a price on Amazon and got a great price. Like it that I can buy and pick it up right there at the store. Easy to use, user friendly iPad. Very light and slim. I am now paying for at least 4 channels on ruku and still don't have new releases. It's mostly older movies. worth for the price. good quality and nice sound. I have gifted to my friend, he is happy with this. like this product works well and enjoy adding my apps The PS4 controller is very nice and feels great in hand. Love the lights and rumble action. Touchpad is also a nice feature. Can't believe however, that you pay $60 for the controller and they can't give you a $3 USB charging cable. So make sure to buy one as well. Sturdy and convenient, cant keep phone in pocket. Strong material and like that it protects screen. The movie itself is good. I hate my time frame had passed to return it, as it's unopened &amp; I realized I had bought another one. What a great action packed movie with great story. Works just fine. It's ink. No problems. I just want the 25 points for doing this review. This was a great movie and was definitely worth the 4.99 I paid for it on sale... I love this laptop! Apple products are great. They are so well designed and they work so flawlessly with one another. I use the laptop for video editing, music editing, projection and document production. Great machine! Is easier to plug in than the previous apple charger versions . My kids enjoy playing this game very much...So much that they don't play COD or GTA as often...THANK GOODNESS It goes with the game series very well. Hoping they make a part 2 More impressed with this key lard each time I use it. Easy to use, sound is clear, hands free, lightweight comfortable Remember the old story of Hansel and Gretel, well, this kicks it up a notch. I wasn't sure I was going to like it, which is why I never saw it when it was in theaters, but in all honestly, it far exceeded my expectations.\n",

        "There is a lot of blood and some adult scenes, so it's definitely not a kid-oriented film and if you are a fan of twisting the G rated children's stories into something exciting for adults, this will fit the bill. It is a good vacuum. I would have preferred to have a longer extension hose. I totally enjoyed the movie, a great girl's night out movie. LOVE THIS MOVIE AND WANTED TO REVISIT IT ON BLURAY I have been waiting to see this Thor and was not disappointed! It's wonderful product......The display is much improved I needed and amplifier to extend my wi-fi throughout parts of my house, and this definitely did it we'll. I wish I got this earlier. Was about to spend over $100 on security camera and related hardware, then found this on sale for $20.. What a steal! I recently upgraded from the original Intuos tablet that was quite old, but after years and years it finally started to give up on me. I was really excited to get a new one that allowed the same hand gestures as the mac touchpad. The pen is very sensitive. The only problem is that sometimes the hand gestures don't register or are a little slow, but overall pretty good. i like the fact it can use kerig cups and it is not as expensive as the kerig and make just as good coffee As expected with new cameras a starting card of 8gb fills too fast. I purchased this 16gb card so that Grace can shoot family adventures, take videos of anything she likes and not worry about deleting because she ran out of space before we could get back home to unload card. In many game sequels they change the game play because they think they improve the game but sometimes it kills the game. Gears of War is not like that game play is same in all series and I love it you can't go wrong with it. Light core skylanders are skylander figures that lights up a part of the character when placed on the portal. In the game, the character has a lights up body part cooresponding to the action figure. The advantage of the lightcore it have a one time AOE when the figure is 1st place on the portal. Other than not much different from the non-lightcore counterpart. Nice product. Decent price. Variety of colors/styles. Out of all the anti-virus programs out there I like the webRoot. Works much better than the knock brands. No loss of pressure or funny taste. I think anyone who's a marvel fan, will love this movie because of its tie to other marvel movies. These wall mounts are great. I used them in my old house for many years and when we moved I purchased them again because they do a great job. They are a great price. They are strong and sturdy. They give you many different angles and options to work with in aiming your speakers at your intended area. Highly recommended! The Mortal Instruments, based upon a young adult book series, could more aptly be named \"Young Adult: The Movie.\" The plot is vapid and full of tropes and concepts from just about every other popular fantasy property out there; don't go into it thinking it's going to be any sort of revelation for the genre. However, the film is well-casted, the actors work really well off of one another, and despite the lack of depth, it's very entertaining. It's great if you're into b-movies. Can't wait to get Cloudy with a chance of meatballs #2 I bought this movie because I like Marvel's superhero movies and Thor is one of my favorites. This is a must see movie if your a fan of marvel super hero movies. Wife wanted something to use with phone and internet browsing, this works well. Light, easy to use, WiFi connected and screen resolution good enough. Glad I waited for this version because it is so light and easy to use. Daughter liked the color (bright pink). Bought to protect the ipad mini. Works fine These mice are great we own several and they go on sale very often! Stock up on them while you can! I really enjoy the picture quality and the features this camera has to offer. Everything is easy to use and is lightweight. Tv's ability to be articulated so that it can be seen in the kitchen when I'm cooking, and then turned toward the breakfast room to watch the news while having breakfast. As well it can be turned toward the living room. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat the whole movie. Graphics and features are great! Play station made great improvements with the new system! Great live performance by Metallica, interspersed with narrative. I was hesitant to buy a universal remote as I had trouble setting it up the last time I bought one. I ended up giving it away. I read the directions and decided to try the codes for the Samsung TV rather than searching. The first code worked and I was all set to use the remote. Great! I wish I hadn't waited so long to dump the lousy cable lease modem. Easy set up and the internet speeds are more stable. holds a lot of data of all kinds nice phone for free. Very nice album with many great songs. Must have for a Daft Punk fan. I like the color and the way the cover easily snaps on and off. Loved the Picture and Special Effects...great realistic story Purchased this controller along with the PS4 I got my boyfriend as a gift. He loves it! Great protection for the I Phone, have had my phone for over two years in the Otter Box and the phone looks brad new. Just bought my second one original case lasted two years. Only downside is that the phone is a little bulky especially when when in the belt case. Love the movie it continues the story line from the Avengers and sets up the next story This is our 4th ipad in the family. The retina display is a huge improvement over the original ipad mini. Gave the ipad mini to the daughter and mama. Got an upgrade. Awesome device! Great feature set if you are an Apple household. Very seamless into the apple ecosystem. Highly recommended. Product does what it is supposed to do, protect the screen. I enjoyed using the headset. It is strong and durable. A great value for purchase. Decent disc space for price Did well in well lit room. This lacked the ability to adjust picture from an angle. It needs keystone adjustments like the next model up. For someone who needs a smaller bag this is just perfect. It is really made well and very user workable. This product was very easy to set up and use. I feel this was a great bargain for the price and would suggest it to everyone. I use the earphones everyday for running and the don't fall off unlike other earphones. I would definitely recommend to others. Love my new phone holder. Keeps my phone secure and easy to use while I am running or walking. It fits novel and love the way it clips in so easily. I would highly suggest this product to anyone that is active and has the life proof case. Thought the story line between father and son was good. Hilarious movie! Blu Ray quality is awesome! Definitely recommend buying! The movie is good. The movie was done well. The cinematography is excellent. Easy to find in store and clerks are very helpful. It works great in my\n",
        "computer also. No complaints. Been a fun game so far, I was going to take a break from 20 dll good price Best metallica show ever . Songs from all the albums Used it in my camcorder. had no problems. Also used it in my Nikon D3200. Nice quality. This movie had very interesting twists. The ending was very surprising. Lots of action. Kept my attention the whole movie. The story line that mixes the old west and space travel. More real\n",
        "view of the way it would be for people. Enjoyed the movie.. Can't wait to see the next one, hopefully they keep the same actors The movie pulls you in as soon as it gets started and holds you there until the end. Great pair of ear buds I use for working out and running. It's a small size memory stick with plenty of memory. It's easy to store and travel with. It's also very easy to use. The only issue is that with it's size it can be easy to lose track off. I would have gave a better review, but I have been having problems with cable internet, I sure most people know what I'm talking about. Overall it is a nice system. I would like to see an update to make it backwards compatible. Brian Regan is Hilarious and I would recommend him to anyone in need of a good laugh. In his comedy he is clean and tasteful so he can be fun for the whole family. In this paticular video he does use a little profanity but nothing major and it isn't anything your child hasn't heard in school already and besides he doesn't use it all the time. Part of his comedy or a huge part of a lot of his jokes is he uses his facial expression to get people to laugh. That is why it is probably important to buy the DVD and not just listen to him but to watch it as well. The movie is great can't wait for the next chapter If you are wanting to use a product that will let you watch your favorite programs this would be the one. TV is mounted securely on the wall.\n",
        "It is in a safe place where it cannot be in the reach of the curious hands of toddlers. It is safe from being knocked on the foor by pets. An excellent addition to any marvel series collection. Fabulas trip back in time for myself and husband :) ...music is upbeat,clear lyrics, funny and amusing. Just looking at those actors when they were so young and just starting careers that by now have blossomed and flourished..a great treat. we laughed so hard..even my older granddaughter got so caught up in it especially after seeing Glee's episode of it. This is a great case protects my iPad from my little one!  This sodastream is a great value and it doesn't take up a lot of counter space. It has saved me money on buying sodas as well. We use ours to make carbonated fruit flavored water. Would recommend and would buy again. This movie is a classic! Now I have it on Blu Ray!! I think the game is awesome brings me back to childhood days im always lookin for olds hool games released in hd I have a Seagate wireless plus and it does not show the files in folders on the drive. I have a 32 gig SD card always in the verbatim transmitter and it streams movies or allows my Ipad or iPhone access with no problems. I think this unit does a great job and I only wish you could access it through a browser like the Seagate. This unit requires the Free App to communicate with your IOS or android devices. So it cannot be used to stream to a notebook computer. Battery life is very good and it is nice as a backup battery for my iPhone too. It has the power to run my 1.5 TB portable HD also. Very Nice device, have recommended it and many friends have purchased it also. We absolutely love our new iPad mini. It has been a great tool for new parents to use and to take on the go. With the exception for the price of the memory card, which was slighter higher for similar products, this card seems to work in most equipment I have that accepts this type of memory card. Therefore, I really have nothing bad to say about how it works. 8GB is plenty of memory to hold most of the pictures I take, music, and games. I bought this product for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day and he loves it! Bought the iPhone for my Mom to use. It is easy to use with lots of functionality. Good price. My daughter loves her headphones. I have to remind her to turn the volume down. Fun color. For the money, you absolutely cannot find better sound quality or bass thump. Setup was a snap, literally like 3 steps. This unit has three sound settings...music, movie, and dialogue. Bass volume is also adjustable. Robin Williams does a great job in a non funny role. He really pulls it off. Good psychlogical thriller A amazing movie overall! A must add to any DVD collection This is a great easy to use wireless mouse. I switch this mouse back and forth between multiple computers with ease. Quick reading, 5-disc changer. Easy to use! Sony has always been a trusted brand and this follows true! This is a great movie I enjoy to watching with the whole family, the content offer by the movie is better than I expected Wish I had a keyboard like this for my iPad. Very responsive. Placement of keys are in usual spots which is quite helpful. . I play this game all day, every day. The series just keeps getting better and better. This is a great game! I've not gotten very far yet, but can't complain. If you loved DK Country Returns, you'll love this one! Has owned this light bulb for over 1 month. Good basic LED light bulb. Got is on clearance for $7.00, I think. Works and hopefuly the electric bill stays low. The light is a nice white and not yellow light other bulbs. Have not tried the dimmer feature. Wished the bulb was at a higher wattage equavalent. Plan to get more of them if the price is right. Purchased this wine cellar a few years ago. Love that it holds 35 bottles. Looks great in my kitchen and is wonderful for when I have guests over to have several bottles of wine chilled. TIMOTHY'S KAHLUA IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE KEURIG CUP FLAVORS. Downton Abbey is rich, lush and elegant. The music, costumes, location - everything is so addicting. I bought Season's 1-3 as a Christmas present for my daughter and had to get S4 as soon as it was released. I play this game all day, every day. The series just keeps getting better and better. I had the old apple tv with the hard drive. I liked it but with the new HD format it wouldn't play the new movies. I already had a newer apple tv in my living room and i never had a problem with it. I decided to but another one to replace the old one in my bedroom. Another great installment in the Marvel movieverse.\n",

Sounds great. Looks great. Microphone comes through nicely to others playing games with you. Very happy with purchase. How much can you say about a storage drive really come on Loved this moved. The story is great as are the performances. The racing sequences are very exciting. Highly recommend this movie I love the movie I'm a big fan I would recommend this product to others it was a great deal best value but I was upset that the steel case cover for the movie price at the same price was not available after only being open for 4 hours great game for play with friends and family im play I bought this product for my Yamaha P-80 piano. It sounds great. The highs are clear (unless played very loudly) and the base response was good. Saved me a lot of money when compared to a keyboard amp. Sounds great, microphone works great. Nice look, if your into stylish gear that performs well this is the headset for you! Very good movie. DVD extras were great. The Marvel OneShot mini movie was what we wanted after Iron Man 3 Happy with the quality for the price point. Didn't want to spend any more for headphones that are being used to work out. I liked the fact that it was leather ,my grand daughter liked that it was pretty and we both liked that it protects her kindle . easy to use. :) i play all day with my family and friends.. The quality of the phone and all the apps for the price, I give high marks for. I am very pleased with the audio and picture quality of the phone and all of the lettering is large enough for anyone to see. Sometimes I wish it were easier to use, Some of the operations are hard to find and remember where they are. I have to do alot of digging to find them. But, overall I am very pleased with the phone and so happy I purchased it! Sometimes, it will accidently dial someone after I put my phone down, if I touch the screen. I really liked this movie....got a great deal on the BluRay/DVD combo, couldn't pass it up. Works great and would recommend to any gamer that loves using a wired connection to their XBOX or PC! Great album by the one and only Tool. They really out did themselves on this one. I recommend this one for anyone!!! Vacuum cleaners very well and does a great job with Carpet. It's very efficient and nicely designed. Love the cleaning efficiency. Priced a little bit high but it's better than Dyson prices. been using this brand for years no issues. Great value for the price. Would recommend to anyone who does alot of recording on dvd's. Good Basic Charger\n",

        "quick charge over all the product for is good a little high priced This is great for the price paid. I got this as a deal of the day for under $50. I bought it to replace a CD/ stereo that did not have the aux jack. I like that the brightness of the red lights can be adjusted. I even installed it myself with some help from the hubby. Save money on the install cost and search the installation instructions for your make and model vehicle on YouTube. A Bluetooth adapter can be added, which is sold separately. Works great and provides great bandwidth throughout the house! Would recommend to anyone who needs a new router or doesnt own one already! Overall a good DVD. I have seen results and will continue to use A great action movie with Denzel Washington and Mark Whalburg together. A mix of shoot em up, comedy, wit, plot twist and \"how do we get out of this one\" movie. If you like the staring actors you will love this movie! I am a samsung person and any products that samsung has I will buy. We only purchase Samsung TVs because the pics are so clear. Would like to have the sound come from the front of the TV instead of the rear. Very easy to set up. I don't know what the other reviews are talking about but this work perfectly to charge the wii u game pad I was looking to purchase a Universal Remote for my house, because I was using multiple remotes for different things. This remote was so easy to program to use. All I needed was the model number and serial number of each device and I was ready to go. I started using the remote within 10 minutes! I highly recommend this particular remote to everyone! Also, they Price Match, too! I was able to get this remote on sale for $59.99! So, if I were you , I would go buy this remote right away! The case provides nice protection and covers the screen. The stand/cover is a nice addition. It does make the screen a little less responsive and the lightning port is a little harder to access. Above average fair with great special effects without dampening the true heart of the movie which is Thor and Loki's relationship. This is a good game and it reminds of the Donkey Kong country games on SNES. My only complaint is that this game is rather difficult and I would consider myself a semi gamer, ie being able to pick up games quickly and not be terrible.Also, the multiplayer seems to be lacking, in that the first player HAS to be Donkey Kong and cannot be any other character while the second player can be anyone else. Maybe I am missing a setting to be able to play as someone else but I dont think so\n",

        "Bottom line, this is overall a good game so far but maybe not for younger kids as this game could be frustrating for them Replaced another net gear router. This was easy to set up. Just connect the cables and plug it in. Comes with a pre-designated password which user can change. One would have to contact netgear in case password is forgotten.. Given the recent relegation that routers can and are being hacked, wish I knew a way to disconnect the ability for someone to hack the router. Price was good. Cable works great. Cable is very durable and flexible. Best cable for the price Love everything about my G4. Can't wait for the G5 Beautiful solid wood cabinet with infrared glass doors. Extra shelf great for a sound bar. I liked that there were a lot of the same characters as the first movie but the story was different Very good movie about the true occurrence of Cpt Phillips ordeal with the Somalian pirates. Very close to the true incident, excellent filming on the ship and life boat. Gives the audience the feel of what it must be like in todays world of merchant shipping and the perils they face. This is a must have for anyone who enjoys the fantasy genre. If you haven't seen the first two seasons get them first With it's real time anti phishing protection, and passwords protection capabilities, along with securing your identity and data while you are on-line, along with award winning Anti-Virus technology, is a good buy. I really like this cause I could size it. I also like that I can lock my phone in. I have used a Kindle for a few years. As my Macular Degeneration advances it has become harder to read on the original one. I purchased the Kindle White after researching it on a few sites. It was recommended by Agencies that deal with eye problems over the Ipad which is harder to read on especially as it gets darker out. As this eye disease advances it affects how I deal with light and dark. Because this Paperwhite is back lit and I can make it as bright as I need it to be. I am enjoying reading again, and would highly recommend it to anyone with similar eye disease. Family enjoys Apple TV. We do not have cable so this functions well for our family tv needs. Needed a good quality cable, but didn't need anything more than 3 feet long. Fit the bill. This game appears a little scary in the beginning but it is really fun and has a nice ending. Overall the game isn't scary it just appears so in the beginning. To be honest I am not huge fan of shooting games but this one was well done. Good product not great, wish it had a longer reach. Slows down if you are too far away. Easy to set up and use. you can hear the message from the caller without having to answer the phone. You can pickup if you want to take the call.\n",
        "Has good range from the base unit. Researched phones and decided that the Moto X was just right for me because I carry the phone in my pocket and did not want a phablet! I've owned it for about a month and have been very happy with it. The active display allow me to monitor messages, calendar events, email without touching the phone. This is my 2nd Bluetooth speaker I tried and I think this one Is a keeper. Ok I don't have 50 characters to say about this case high price I purchased this to backup my photos using my network. once I got it home I found that it was perfect for backing up all of my computers I love the action of this movie and the the plot.. Entertaining Predator movie much better than the AVP ones. I received on time, ease to install, excellent performance, easy transaction. I would recommend this HDD to a friend. Fantastic little pointer for presentations in front of large groups..... Love my Mophie! Phone case fits phone snugly and seems like it would be good protection - maybe not as good as an Otterbox. The phone case uses a standard micro USB cable for charging - the kind that all Android phones use now - so you can't pop it onto an Ihome radio without removing the case - but I don't have that anyways. I use my phone down to about 20% battery and then slide the little switch and the phone is brought back up to about 100% charge - very handy!! Would definitely recommend to a friend Great price. Love it has a sleep timer This is a very nice basic mouse. So far the battery usage is not bad. We bought this for my son to use on his laptop and he loves it! Got a great deal on it. Does what all SD cards do. The Roku 3 is much more powerful yet I did not need to reprogram my Harmony Remote in order to use it.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is the first streaming device I have used that is not marginally underpowered. Even my net capable BluRay player is sloooowww. Why manufacturers think it's OK to use a tiny processor which is barely adequate for the original firmware and with future versions, the firmware gets bloated and problems start is beyond me unless planned obsolescence is purpose built.\n",
        "\n",
        "So far the Roku 3 has a healthy margin of power well above what it needs at this point leaving room for future features. I think these devices in general are reaching maturity finally. For under a C note it's difficult to go wrong with the Roku 3. Excellent earphones! Sound is amazing, but what is really impressive is the noise canceling. The ear phones are as good if not better than the over the ear noise canceling models. this game reminds me of the classic Donkey Kong Country games on Super Nintendo. well worth the price and very tasty. highly recommend this item for all. An enjoyable series, although the premise was a bit odd. Once Michael was burned, and the various folks from the agency and other groups, well, not much meat on that rib. The plot, characters and acting is exceptional, as it has been in the first three seasons. I can't wait for season 5!!! I like the phone and the speed is fast too. The size is perfect because it fits in my pants pocket without looking like a banana. I give it 9 out of possible 10 due to nothing is perfect. Price is right and storage is really good. easy to work with and transfer of files. It may not have the high end look, but it works like the best. The headphones work the way they are advertised, light weight, very portable, you can wear them while working out, jogging, cycling without worrying about wire dangling around you.\n",
        "\n",
        "Price wise, they are very reasonable. Sound quality... well these are not designed for the best sound quality, but it is acceptable. Very happy with the shredder so far, would recommend it to others The Prequel to the Lord of The rings. I enjoyed the extended beginning, and how it makes a few more things clear. I will continue to watch the remainder of the movies. However they should do away with the short version of all the films, and just have the extended formats. Very nice album. The deluxe album comes wth a patch as well as music videos. I've used higher end Sennheisers in audio production before and have always been impressed. Decided to try this more budget model for some less critical stuff around the house. As someone who cannot get used to earbuds and on-ear designs, I found these comfortable and light. Almost too light. I get the feeling they won't hold up if I wanted to travel or use them professionally. They're great to put on for casual listening though. And while you don't get the same awesome sound as high end headphones, they perform respectably, stressing clarity over bass. If you want cans that BOOM, look elsewhere. But I've been able to listen for hours without discomfort or fatigue. Better than your average below $30 headphones, in my experience. It is a handsome little appliance that fits snugly on the shelf. It has a convection feature which is important to me. I have reheated a casserole, made toast, grilled cheese sandwiches, toasted coffee cake. The instructions were clear and easy to follow. Everything turned out well. I've been a Kevin Hart fan for quite some time &amp; this is his funniest standup yet - my stomach, sides, cheeks, basically EVERYTHING, hurt from laughing so hard! So glad that we went with a good quality HDMI cable! We researched it and found that we would get a better image with the appropriate HDMI cable! This is a great purchase for the price!  Really good action movie and i got a great deal on it. amazing cinematography, sandra bullocks acting blows george clooney off the ship... best movie this year with Dallas Buyers Club included.. Good movie, great action, but it's a sequel.\n",
        "No doubt about it, Liam Neeson is a great actor. Easy set up &amp; works great in any room of my house, great price Good music for all ages and has a variety of different artists This is a perfectly fine little CD/DVD burner for a laptop or netbook. Works fine and is small enough to carry with your netbook in a case. Turisas, a band I did not get into until their second album never fail to make a great album. Filled with their brand of Finish folk metal. Works well and is reliable. Everyone at work wanted one Does exactly what it is made to do! Hope everyone uses this product! I have allways liked action movies and I own the first movie thor Included digital copy only on Itunes I don't use Itunes and have no intention of doing so\n",
        "Apple is fine for those how don't mind all the restrictions they place on you. A rip roaring fun ride, that you do not want to end. It is classic Lego but set in the Marvel universe. Great storyline and game play. If you are a fan of the Lego series, this is a must have. Another great addition for the Avenger franchise. Story is good and special effects are great. Worth owning. Was a Movie i wanted to add to my Movie Collection Love the cars and the extra gadgets that u get to use both cop and racer Jeff Dunham and his puppets were delightful. Walter was my overall favorite. His greeter at Walmart was choice. Peanut came in a close second. Great movie on the classic tale. I wasn't sure I was going to like this but it was actually very good. Great prices but very small in size keyboard. Service is always great and I'm glad you offer wheel chairs for customers since I recently broke my leg and every time I go I can use their wheel chair and makes me want to come back and purchase more items from the store. When you know the real story, movies just don't get it. Hard to put real life drama into this movie. But, all in all, not a bad night in Again another great movie based on a Marvel comic. A much better, and more sinister villain. And Kat Dennings makes for some great funny moments. Plug and play.\n",
        "Did exactly what I wanted it to do. Not one failure from the entire spindle. Last spindle were Sony discs and about one in every 20 failed to write. I will only use Memorex from now on. Great picture. Great sound. Easy set up. Much clearer picture compared to other t.v. 'S. Assassin's Creed IV is a really fun game and well developed! I've never played any of the other games but based on this one, I believe that are just as good and fun! I bought this game just to pass time while I wait for games like Infamous Second Son, Watchdogs, Dying Light, and Evolve! But this ended up being an awesome game with a never ending adventure! Great game that I recommend to anyone! Fast shipment, product as advertised. Works great. Great product easy to use. Uses mini USB to charge. The charger is not included but a universal one works. Great to use for add ons to games like rock smith. Nice power. I wish it would show cover art for pandora.. other than that no complaints. This is a great Bluetooth mouse. It feels comfortable in my hand and is easy to get used to. It might be hard to use for someone with small hands but I believe even they could get the feel for it. I went to see in theatre and had to have in my movie collection I now can get HD and the picture is wonderfully clear, The colors are strong. Some of the scenery is breathtaking. I can watch my favorite basketball game with ease--pick out the players, follow the action, colors strong. Even the old movies in black and white look great. The sound is good, but I am considering a sound bar. I'm happy to know that our new TV is protected with this surge protector! It's a necessity!! wish it had been available in different colors, and think the price was too much. Following up on the Asgard tales was the best part to me, this movie follows the comic version of Loki's quest for the throne of Asgard, the acting and settings brings back memories of reading the original comics when I was a teenager, and I can't wait to see the next installment of Thor. I bought this for my daughters camera. It was on sake and for the price I got it for, I couldn't pass up the deal. Plenty of memory for what my daughter needed it and the price was unbeatable. loved the movie, didn't get to see it in 3D but would have loved the thrill ride it would have been. Sandra Bullock is always a plus in any movie. and George Clooney is still great. This movie was very suspenseful and the footage was literally out of this world. This movie will be watched numerous time. It is better to watch in a completely dark room and no outside noise to get the full effect of the cinematography. For ease of watching movies on iTunes on your HD tv... this is the bomb! When they get more varied programming I'll be happier. Bought this tv and it's great. The picture is amazing, love the fact that it connects to the internet and all the apps it has. And most of all the price was great. This product was bought to upgrade the sound coming from my tv. I can hear the dialog better and the bluetooth streaming works great. This is not meant for home theater sound, but it sure is better than the sound from a tv. I was so tired of Android smartphones - was on my 3rd and really got tired of the freezes and stuck screens, so I decided I'd go with the Iphone 5s. So far the phone has worked great, calls are clear and the camera takes very nice photos. My only gripe so far is that when I'm on a call I can't look at an e-mail or access the weather. I get a message that says can't access data while on a call. My wifes 4s has no problem like that so maybe there is just a setting that needs to be changed. I also got a Mophie Juicepack Air charging case and love it. use phone down to 20% battery and flip the switch and phone is brought back up to 100% battery. LOVE IT!! Great fun Movie, Saw it in the Theater and decided then to get the movie on 3D Blu-Ray. Great!! Product for students or great for people trying to stay in a budget would recommend over all other products that claim to be the best go get one today to stream favorite movies music or stream your photos from your iPhone or Mac Use my new blender almost everyday. I now understand why certain smoothie shops have their blenders covered. It is pretty loud for the 60 seconds it takes to get a great breakfast smoothie on the go. The extra (tall) blade really works to make sure there are no lumps. I looked at a competing brand but decided to try the Ninja for a cost savings. It's a great buy! Very simple, easy to use, but sometimes there will be no water problems. But in fact, has been filled with water.If have timer switch on/off will even better. This was a great movie like the first one. Had to add this to my collection. The first thing I noticed upon picking up the iPad Air is just how light it is. I have always liked the previous generations of the iPad but really felt it was to heavy. I know that sounds crazy but when you are holding an electronic device for long periods of time, that is something to think about. I really liked the 1st generation iPad mini because of the form factor and weight. The iPad Air is really just a larger screened iPad mini as far as the form factor goes. The retina display is truly candy for the eyes when viewing videos, checking emails, or surfing the net. I previously owned a Google Nexus 10 and one of the main things that the iPad Air has over it is the incredible battery life. I have been getting multiple days use on a single charge. Another advantage is the App Store. There are so many more apps designed for the iPad than there were for the Nexus 10. Don't get me wrong, I really like the Android operating system and I currently have a Samsung Galaxy S4. I really like the widgets on my phone but I really don't miss not having them on my iPad Air. In conclusion, the iPad Air is a great tablet that is easy to use and I just can't say enough about the battery life! This is a great addition to my dvd library. Have always enjoyed Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. Seem like genuinely nice people The original version is an all time favorite. This is a must have for your collection Good price and enhances my the look of everything that I do. I was hoping to be impressed by this Logitech keyboard, and thankfully I am. The backlit function works quick when you wave your hand over the keyboard, and I never really turn off the keyboard because the battery life is so good. From the store display I wasn't totally sure if the keys were going to be really good or not, but my first impression from using it for real was that it felt like using a high-end keyboard with keys that are easily pressable and comfortable to use. You can toggle the brightness of the backlight and the only gripe I can think of is that the backlight auto turns off fairly quickly and there doesn't seem to be any way to change the duration. It's a very minor complaint as having backlit in the first place is quite helpful. There is a mute, volume control and calculator shortcut button, as well as others which work better than standard or package brand name keyboards. Overall I'm loving it. Way better than the monthly subscription. This allows my son to play when he's in the mood to and to let it lapse without having change anything online. Excellent value for the money. Clean signal, but lacks heavy duty cable, plugs, and strain relief. It's fine if you're going to plug it in and forget about it. I wouldn't recommend using it in applications where it will be plugged in, unplugged repeatedly. moved around a lot, or put under stress. Love getting this for a gift for gamers. They are always needing more Microsoft point. This Mic stand works great on my Yeti and its worth the money, I can place it anywhere on my desk and have it work with me. Worth the money spent on it This particular camera case hits all of what I'm looking for in a small camera bag. I especially like the belt strap that is held by velcro. Easier to take on and off the belt. The semi-hard material protects the camera really well. Enjoy!! This lens has been around a long time. Every bag should have one. Its light, very fast and you can't beat it for the price. Sorry, it doesn't zoom. you'll have to........move back and forth to frame the subject. You can probably use the exercise. Great music that is legendary. Prince is one of the Best This is a very durable product. Thoroughly protects from falls of 5 ft for sure. ;) The clip is useful to slip on a jacket or pants when other methods are not preferred. Although it is not considered water proof it does keep most areas covered well. This product in no way interferes with the sound or speaking mechanisms on your phone. very nice Inverter y for the money excellent price I've never been a huge Maiden fan but enjoyed what I heard from them. Picked this up to add Maiden to my permanent library and it's a good compilation. Excellent addition to my mobile storage options. 5 stars. I tried another brand first for music in my car, but when the temperature dropped below 25 degrees so did the flash drive. That's not the case with this drive, it has worked for me down to 10 degrees so far. For a budget speaker under 100 this is a good deal Not sure I understand how to use some of the features the camera has. I think the manual could have done a better job in explaining features and how to use them a little better. I really like my Studio C Tutti laptop sleeve. It's stylish and lightweight. Not to mention, it had a plush lining inside. My laptop fits inside perfectly and it's great as opposed to a laptop case. Dont want to spoiler any part but we saw it at the theater in Imax 3D so it became a must buy for the home 3d theater. It would be great if this came in a value pack and the other black cartridge came separate Love this sound bar!! You can actually feel the sound of the movies!! Great price for a great product!! Sandra Bulloch &amp; Melissa McCartney are great together! Don't miss this movie! Xbox gift cards are good as a gift for friends who have xbox 360 etc. I like them because if you are low on cash, You can always just choose a lower amount for yourself; or others. I like it mostly, for the choices in amount fee when purchasing them. Microsoft offers a 15 dollar one, a 25 dollar one, and a fifty dollar value for game purchasing. Overall, good product for the price. If ear buds were a bit bigger they'd be great. Sound quality is pretty good. Microphone works very well, I'd recommend to some. Not all. Package should've added a bigger earbud. Running out of characters but have to have fifty. Ease of installing cartridges and color is amazing. Price is not bad either. I love the feel of the cover. The inside stand is very useful. Good device for home and small scale business. Easy to handle Good as always. My son stopped playing WOW for a while and Mists convinced him to go back to it. He's very happy with the story and graphics. I got this game for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day and he loves it! He's been playing it nonstop and would definitely recommend it for other guys as well as it is a great gift to get your significant other if they are a gamer! When I buy a computer I am just looking for a computer that works fast, has enough storage for my many papers, PowerPoints, and Excel projects for school, and that surfs the web fast. I don't do anything with video other than use youtube occasionally or watch Blip so I don't need anything exceptional great. I have a MacBook Pro but got annoyed with only having a laptop. I wanted a desktop too and so I read a lot of reviews and did extensive research on the iMac and the Mac Mini. After reading the reviews I decided that the Mac Mini would work just fine for me. I love a lot of the features but I wish it came automatically installed with things like Adobe Reader which I need for school. As a college student I do a lot of writing, especially late at night, and I prefer a desktop. This was exceptionally easy to set up, less expensive (but still plenty expensive for a college student), and runs well. All in all I recommend it if you don't plan to create videos or do a lot of gaming. If you do like to do those two things I would choose the iMac. Either way, I prefer a Mac to a PC which is why I have both a MacBook Pro and a Mac Mini. I am a big marvel fan and this movie did not disappoint. I love my new iPad. I chose the mini for portability. It's very easy to use. The one drawback is the availability of cases for the mini w/retina display. The cases that are available are very expensive. Very good range through out house.It seems like there's two message areas , I can only receive some others are still stuck in there.But for price nice phones. Can't run my computer without it! I always buy this program when I get a new computer. bought this card for my cellphone lots of space. Easy to install great quality I bought this watch for one reason, missing calls. Die to my work my phone is always on vibrate and I would miss calls. I never miss calls now my watch vibrates and I can see who called. I can read text messages and preview emails. I wonder how I lived without it! I was tired of dealing with ink for inkjet printers. Needed something that had fast and abundant output. This printer does it's job and does it well. This is my second Otter purchase. Excellent design, durable and consistent quality. This is a must own for any Metallica fan. A good selection of tunes from their catalog and it simply pumps you up to want to go nuts. I feel the movie component of the film was very well done and there was good balance between the band playing and the action in the streets. I love it, and I don't have to get up and change the song, I can do it from the couch to where it's plugged in. Great for a small space, yet large enough to fit a large dinner plate. The +30 button is great. All the speed buttons are easy to read and programming the clock was a breeze. Cleans up in a snap. I brought this watch for my husbands birthday and he loves it. He's been wanting a G sport watch. It's durable and great looking. I wish I had purchased one with a larger dial. The price was great.. Vibration is good and better when purchase of warranty Came in handy big time, just downloaded movie and plugged into TV to watch movie or pics Purchased to be able to use large monitor with Mac Air. Worked as promised For any fan of the Scorpions, or fans of hearing popular songs done acoustically, this album will satisfy on both fronts. This band has been around for many years and are expert craftsman when it comes to their performance. This album is no exception. It delivers many fan favorites in a way they haven't been heard before, and from a very unique venue proving the worldwide status of these rock icons. I'm a Volbeat fan, but had been waiting to but their newest album until the tour edition came out. It was not a disappointment. The album is quite solid with good songs and some excellent guest artists. The DVD that comes with is pretty awesome. It has a good blend of Volbeat's newest songs along with the older favorites everyone is looking to hear. A great purchase for a fan. My Son is 3 and we were searching for his 1st set of headphones, these were perfect. The price was great, the quality of the headphones was awesome. It's volume controlled for a child, not too loud, but yet not to soft with the volume. He love them. Great album. They're last was a bit more catchy but mind over matter has a much more mature sound Awesome, tight plot. The best special effects of 2013. The movie cries out for IMAX 3D. Not bad on Blue Ray. Great movie! My family and I really enjoy the super hero movies they are really great!  I needed to buy some add-ons for my game and this was just a great deal I couldn't pass!! they are easy install and can take of to use in another controller if needed. silicone pads help ease the pressure needed to use the analogs I wanted a simple device to play the CDs that I had. This does so quite well, It is exactly what I had in mind when I went into the store. This headset is really great for the price. It cancels out a lot of noise and has pretty good sound. I'm prone to losing my headsets and at the price this one is, I don't worry about it! I traded my iOS device for this and I will never go back. This is a much better deal and the option to expand memory absolutely amazing and if you get a 32g micro sd on sale it is perfect. im not a big mircrosoft fan or sony for that matter but I do own a xbox 360 and xbox one and I really like the one but my day one edition broke, something about not reading discs it was common error for day one editions, I have a regular edition now tho and no probs but I do have extended warranty just incase as with all first gen of new consoles Its great that they are sold together so you know you will always have the other colors and its a great price Great gift for the gamer who most everything. I can't keep track of the games my son has so this is a great solution. He can get what he wants, when he wants and take advantage of the sales. I needed some more PlayStation money and this was a great deal!! Does the job for a reasonable price. Have had these before, still a good value. I recommend to buy all this artist music. He sings very well from slow jams to smooth jazz/ R &amp; B. His music make a person feel relax and think about back in the day events/situations. This artist keeps it real. Listening to the lyrics and the melody will relax you and make you play songs over and over and over. I love his music. I will go see this artist perform anywhere. He is performing on cruises and jazz shows. I will be there everytime if I am able. Good fitting, but not perfect. great self-unwinding wire All the best music from Grammy artists in one place. It doesn't get any better than this. I'm addicted to it. It's so easy to just spend the evening checking email, catching up on news and communicating with family with a screen big enough to make it entertaining It's a jack it works like it should. It was delivered on time nice little package it works with all my headphone. I use it on a keyboard. Works great. Pleased with order It is a Sandra Bullock show case movie. George Clooney was in it for about 20 min. the rest of the movie was all Sandra.\n",
        "Might make some younger children scared and not want to go to bed at night. Needed lightweight camera...have really enjoyed how good this camera is...replaced Elph I lost in Belize....Elph line is the best! Works real well and is small enough to fit on a key chain. It looks good and easy to use and it is simple to carry. What I love about the headphones the most is the noise cancellation. The clarity of the sound is outstanding. I am very happy I have purchased the headphones. They are clearly the best headphones I have ever owned. It shreds what it says it does; 10 pages at a time, credit cards, CDs/DVDs, works like a charm! Purchased with the Mac. Easy installation. No problems using with previously used documents written in Windows. The game is esay to pass level and the resolution and graphic is great. We just needed this Cable connector to extend our internet cable so we could move the router to a place with better reception. It worked. this is a terrific monitor. It looks awesome. great price too. I really enjoyed this router. I was in desperate need of an update!! I love to use the Neat system just so I can declutter my office; keeps all documents easily organized. I love it! I usually watch a video works that I made, and the Belkin adapter helped me a lot of times to check every detail. Also, this is an excellent product to watch movies/youtube more comfortable. So if you are an Xbox One and/or PS4 \"hardcore gamer\" you probably don't care about the Wii U. I will probably end up buying one or both of the other systems, and I am really enjoying the Wii U so far. New Super Mario Bros U, Super Mario 3D World, Need for Speed: Most Wanted U, and Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze are all excellent so far. I am sure the next Zelda game will be great too. So basically, if you love the classic Nintendo franchises, then this system is a no-brainer. It comes with New Super Mario Bros U and Luigi U, and Mario is well worth it! I'm sure Luigi is good too, but there are other great games to play first. this was a great game for my two children. It was easy for my daughter to pick up on the control settings and movements of the characters. Dont really know how to review a battery for a camera This monitor works great, has a great picture, what more can it or could it do?? Hmmm...better speakers. I loved this \"Captain Philips\" DVD movie. Watched it on the edge of my seat, and recommended it to my family, friends and co-workers. The scenes were exciting and literally pulled you in!\n",
        "Great, great movie. Bravo Tom Hanks and director! This was easy to install and clearly, my internet speeds are faster over wifi. The sales guy recommended it...seems worth it. Just the right size for my camera and accessories. I like the compartments and padding for protection. Nice document print quality. It was easy to install and start using. This is probably the best battery extender made for the IPhone 5 or 5S There were a couple of changes to get used to, but after a few uses its great. this is great for techno challenged it was easy to set up and easy to connect wirelessly to it can even get signal out in my driveway I replaced a Harmony One the dog ate. During setup it found the old data online and programmed the new unit just like the old. The buttons are more responsive and it responds quicker. I actually like that it is battery powered rather than needing to go on the charger. Half the price of the original Harmony One. I love the camera, it's cheap and good! I sent as a present for my God daughter and she love how small it's the camera and how good works. Great sound quality, easy to, very comfortable to wear. One of my favorite movies in a beautiful presentation. Great transfer, very affordable price, an excellent purchase. Thanks! I love this movie. Everything about it screams 1980's and they do a great job with poking fun of not only the past, but the present. needs more character choices and less story breaks. Awesome game. So real! Haven't bought a sports game in over a decade and wow have they changed. Controls take awhile to master. I LOVE the '94 Anniversary edition that's included. exiting\n",

        "acting great good movie... kept up the interest factor till the end. Great antenna if you're in a good area I tried this antenna at my boyfriends house about 10 miles further away from the city and it only picked up like 2 channels but I tried it at my place which is closer and picked up quite a bit more. Pretty steady viewing a few channels cut in and out everyone once in awhile but overall it's pretty good. Great cover, perfect fit, soft on the phone, durable and protective There are a few filler wrestlers in the Royal Rumble itself but overall a good pay per view event! You can't get a better screen protector and easy to install Super tablet,,,but the wife could not get it in her purse...very fast and impressive.. The different sizes of ear buds allowed me to find the best fit for me and make listening to music comfortable and pleasant. The sound is amazing! Its the first programmable remote I bought that my wife actually likes. The help function is good at recovering from problem start ups. The keypad layout is much improved from earlier models. We're getting a second one for the den. its ok. Its really plain I do like how it is really thin and it's pretty light the case good the only thing i don't like is that when I close it there is nothing between the screen and the keyboard I put a pice of cloth in between just incase I just don't want i screen to get scratched. Comfortable and they stay in place. I usually use them while watching movies on my iPad in bed. My kids love the game cause its has multiplayer Now &amp; they can can play with friends &amp; other people. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 this movie is amazing. i was laughing the entire time and nearly wet my pants from laughing so hard!!! This sound bar works great with my 55\" insignia tv. Another wonderful Disney/Pixar movie. The bear is a little scary for young children though. I would suggest children be at least 8 years old before seeing this movie. Chromecast is awesome. Brings Netflix and other select vid apps to a HDTV with minimal cost. Can easily share my entire laptop screen on my big screen too. Affordable enough to buy one for every tv in the house . I went a little to big for my desk area, but have managed to fit it in. It has great picture quality and was easy to put together PROTECTS YOUR SCREEN EXCELLENTLY FROM SCRATCHES. CLEAR TO SEE THRU. It's great to watch a film that has an original plot for this day and age instead of comic book, explosive idiocy. There isn't a great deal of the thrill lost going from the theater to blu ray disc. I like the fitbit and like all the tracking that it does; however, the sleep addition is not worth the extra money over the less expensive fitbit. You have to push the button when you are going to sleep, remember to push it when you wake in the night and push it again when going to sleep. It takes me too long to fall asleep to get the bang for the buck for this feature. I really enjoyed Thor and greatly enjoy the Marvel movies The water filter works well, it is the second one we have used and it seems to do a good job. I like how it does all the work for me and I don't have to constantly keep an eye on it. Great for busy people who uses the net a lot. This game I felt was hyped up but square enix dropped the ball on this one. Aside from some nice visuals the game doesn't really offer much else. The looting and exploring is very limited even the skills are somewhat disappointing The plug is a little big which takes up the whole outlet unless you plug it in upside down which I had to do on both ends. I had a very old Nikon camera that lasted for 40 plus years . I am hoping this Nikon lasts as long as my old one. Very durable high quality pictures. Easy to use , little pricy but worth it if it lasts as long as my other one . Time will tell. These earphones fit comfortably, better than most retail product. The quality surprised my expectations, very clear, perfect amount of bass, definitely recommended. The mic control works flawlessly, solid construction. Will definitely be buying another pair to have in case I lose these. awesome product would highly reccomend for the price Getting it started was a bit frustrating. But, once set up we couldnt stop playing with it and learning all it can do. Great gift of encouragement for any music lover. I bought the speakers to help with the sound on my old laptop and it really helped. I am very happy about them and would recommend them to anyone who need a set of speakers. Excellent product definitely would recommend. Great product easy to travel with sales clerk was very informed, and extremely helpful. Last chapter of a interesting story with interesting characters, love the music and the musicians. I love this movie..cause it has it all. Has comedy. Romance. Has lots of action. Plot twists that keep you glued to your seat. Entertaining. Goes in detail about Loki. Thor happy to be in love. He doesn't care about becoming king. He wants to be a good man .shows even super heroes want to be normal. Old Christmas standards combine with newer tunes to celebrate the season in Chicago's captivating style. If you love their music, you will delight in their covers of tunes like \"Winter Wonderland\" and \"Little Drummer Boy.\" This talented band keeps you moving during the entire 20-song CD - you will find yourself dancing throughout (especially to \"Let it Snow, Let it Snow, Let it Snow!\") Portable, easy to use, great for everyday browsing and gmail users. SanDisk - Pixtor 16GB microSDHC Class 10 Memory Card is superior, also a great price. Would highly recommend. I loved the movie if you love the avenger you'll love this one. Love all Mac products and this is no exception. Easy to use. Bought this because this is a classic movie of my generation and it was on a really good sale. The storyline is awesome. If you haven't seen this yet, you are really missing out! Game is great if you like the original however you can only play one player on 360 console. I enjoyed this movie overall. It was fun and well acted, but slow at times. The black and white was a nice way to make it surreal, but the actors portray their characters in a very real and consistent manner. Highly recommended. My first track pad for Mac. Was easy to learn and now prefer to use it over any conventional mouse. Gestures are very intuitive. Great movie overall! 3D was great! Probably one of the best 3D movies to TV out so far Excellent ipad protection for active 6 years old boy. This ink is pretty good--the color is strong. Unfortunately, it runs out too quickly, but I guess that always happen with ink. Great product for the price. Glad to have found at my local store Great next gen game, very good single player game. Offers ability to complete game silently or guns blazing. Overall my phone case is amazing. Love it, it protects my phone so well. I have a 2 ye old and I have to keep him away from my phone but with my case it's prefect. I have nothing but good things to say about my new incase phone case for my iPhone 5s. It fits my everyday need. Nice, clean, and shiny controller. I was looking for a fourth controller so this addition looks great next to my C3PO conrtoller. The shape and feel of the keyboard is really nice and easy to type on. MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH A SMART PHONE. IT IS EASY TO USE, DEPENDABLE. TAKES GREAT PICTURES. GETS GOOD SIGNAL ANYWHERE I HAVE BEEN. Webroot has caught several threats in just the first month. It takes care of itself and takes great care of our internet safety.  It is a great marvel movie. A must own to add to your movie collection. PS Plus enables user to download free games on PS3 and PS4 which is great, the annoying thing is that you have to be registered in order to play online on your PS4, something that was not forced upon the user on a PS3, other than that the PS Plus is useful and definitely enhances the use of your console regardless it being a 3 or a 4. Purchased the item came home plugged into stereo and had music. I really enjoy this CD. With the great variety of artists and songs I find that I can let it play and don't have to skip any songs. The artist choices are quality and represent some of the best! easy to use and install a pleasure to use instalation was a snap For a tablet not branded by Apple or Samsung, this is a very solid tablet. It performs great and the App Store still carries many of the great apps people love. Great tablet for someone not able to shell out the bigger bucks on the previously mentioned brands. This sub was a great addition to my home theater. Looks good and sounds good. Modem was great for Time Warner Cable. Would recommend over lease. Overall this the best phone case (holder) I have ever owned. I would recommend taking a serious look at it if you are in need of new or different case Second season of a really good drama with New Orleans as a backdrop with great music and the original Musicians. Touch pad and sound comes right from the controller! The cord is extra long so it goes from my basement to my dining room it's just what I needed!!!! The product was affordable and it was working as it was expected. Need to extend my RCA cables to move equipment. Very easy to use and price was great. This is a really great movie for the kids to watch. They enjoy every part of the movie. My son loved the first one and thought the second one was just as good and funny. Overall this is the best case I have had for one of my devices. Given the high price tag of the Galaxy Note 3 it was very important to me to protect the investment completely and this case delivers. Very good sound quality .unlike other headphones .\n",

        "Y My kids love this game, especially being able to change the way the story goes from the movie version. I am very happy with my Kindle HDX 8.9. It is thinner than my other Kindle Hd and lighter in weight. It is not hard to set up but if you have problems there is a button you can push to ask for help. I would recommend this Kindle e-reader. Easy out of the box setup. Sharp color quality. Very simple wireless setup. Good wireless range. One of the best movie of 2013 and great price and great to own it. Our LCD TV stopped working and wanted to replace it with the same size tv screen but did not want to spend a lot. This Sharp was the best picture for the least price. It's small, powerful, and great battery life; even better it's a Mac! We have had 3 different surround systems go defective on us. We are hoping this will last us a good long time, per I can hear the TV with this bar better than any speakers we've used. I'm a bit hard of hearing and this is working great for me. I have not used the cartridge yet. Bought ahead of time. If I have problems will be sure to let you know. Love Love Love this Sound system! easy to use and fantastic quality. Worth the money. DVD player, gaming system, and online access all in one. So far so good but shortly after applying I noticed a small amount of discoloration to one of the edges as though the membrane weren't entirely in contact with the screen-so far a few weeks later and no peeling. the case seems durable. it has had no tears or deficiencies I recomend this product is high quality item easy to find and the attention was great I need to extend my speakers. I bought this because of ease of use and price. Was able to get the speakers in the new location. Cables were perfect for the job. My family does a lot of printing. There are school home work and hobby projects every week that use a lot of ink. This type of ink last longer and still looks good on plain paper. Due to the water content of this ink the plain type paper will roll up before drying all the way. I place it face down with a large book on top. That always takes care of the curling. Great story the dragon is back from his immortal sleep because an old enemy is returning and he wants his revenge. Not bad at all for using at the house. Its simple and just works. I only buy it because the price was fair and I'm a fan of alien movies. I wanted something fast yet light weight for easy transport through the airports. Remember no CD/DVD, however everything today is digital download anyway c\n",
        "So far everything is flawless. My teen's phone broke with no insurance on it and contract not up until June. Great replacement until then. Cute movie, but like Despicable Me better. Quality is great Headphones have good sound and great comfort for economically priced product. The overall movie was great because of the fact only two people are actually acting, everyone else are average people who are pulled into the situations. This is what makes it funny. it was entertaining, and had allot of action, weapons, a few laughs, just a typical guys movie. for the price it is a very nice case, better then most others I have seen and had before like how the case shows off my phone and love the color accent; have to clean it out once in awhile I'm not quite sure if this flash is much more powerful than the camera's built in flash but it seems fine for general, non professional use. Over all, for the money it seems like a good buy. My little one watches this movie over and over and I still enjoy it each time I see it. Factory replacements, perfect fit and performance. We had the regular DVD versions of the movies and really love the improvement in quality with the Blu-Ray version. At first it was wicked fast, but now it's slowing down. I only have 2 devices hooked up and it's supposed to support ~6. It's fine though. Very small and easy to use. I is just what I wanted. I definitely think this film is an improvement over the first Thor. Loki steals the show. Solid supporting cast, top notch action and special effects. My favorite tablet I've purchased one for each of my kids and for my wife use for all my sales reps just one terrific device I'd highly recommend We bought the Roku because we wanted access to Time Warner Cable, but we didn't have wiring in the room. Was surprised how easy it was to use and all the options it contained. I really like the printer, although I haven't had a chance to use it very much. Every thing that I have printed out so far has turned out great. Only thing is, that the \"easy\" wireless set up is a nightmare and I still haven't been able to figure it out. So I'm still forced to hook up every time I need to print anything. It may be a personal problem though. I really enjoy the printer and it doesn't bother me too much that I have to hook up, it would just be nice. This is a very basic mouse pad, which is just what I wanted. Used to connect my optical out on Sony LED 32 inch TV to a sound bar to add more sound volume and base to my viewing options. Perfect cable length so it does not show, and it was priced wonderfully too Decent amount of space for the sale price it was at the time. It is easy to use and I just use to watch you tube and read news. Fairly easy to start and nor bulky. I like the iPhone because of he smaller size; it fits in my hands and the apps and functionality Downton Abbey is a great period piece to watch. The characters are richly played by good British and American actors. This is the fourth season of the series continuing the story line five months after the future Earl of Grantham was killed. Great Sunday afternoon movie to watch. Can't wait for the next season to come out on disc. Enjoy!!! The legrand in wall power kit is a quality unit that comes with everything you need to conceal the power cord and hdmi cables in the wall. The only real concern that I have is with the size. It is a very large unit. Other than that it is a very good system. We put this wireless printer in our home office and love it! We like HP products and this one pleases us too. Very fast and great clarity of print. This true story deserved to be made, as the main characters are big personalities and champion race car drivers. Sadly, the movie does show what happens when the drivers run out of luck, but is true to life.\n",
        "Great cinematography and actors make it a worthy purchase. Took a few days for all the \"bubbles\" to go away. Not cut absolutely perfect but good enough. Very tough. A little more grabby than just the glass for some touch games.... I enjoyed the movie and the picture was so clear on the blue ray player. definitely recommend the movie! This film is not nearly as bad as a lot of critics made it out to be. It is at least as good as the last couple of Pirates films. I am not saying that it should win any awards, but I was at least able to stay entertained throughout. A little spendy but fit great and quality sound. Works perfect with my iphone 5s!! I PLAN ON TRAVELING AD WANTED SOMETHING PORTABLE\n",
        "AND WITH A FAIR SIZED SCREEN AND THIS FITS THE BILL\n",
        "FOR ME. Great way to revision in HD a top selling game of the early 2000s. Its like seeing a great friend that you haven't seen in years The features are excellent for the price. It was easy to set up. Great small microwave. It has easy to use controls. I love how it fits tightly in the holster. I would buy this again. This is quite a bit of money for a standard pedometer but totally worth it. Keeping track of steps is fun and easy. I do have one complaint. My family has these and I wish we could track our individual day's steps for each other. It keeps a running tally for the last week but I think daily would be more competitive. Worth the purchase just for the marvel one shot film. Saw this game at Seattle PAX last August and have been waiting patiently for its release. It has not disappointed. The graphics are great and I like how you can choose to turn off focus if you want. Still playing and haven't found anything I haven't liked yet. Great game play. It's tons of fun for the whole family. Except for the obscenities the adults will be screaming in frustration. Easy to learn; difficult to master. After spilling liquid on my old keyboard I needed to buy a new one. I'm amazed how quiet the typing is. I use the keyboard all day and it is left on from morning to night so was surprised when I had to finally charge it and it had been 30 days since I hooked it up. Well worth the money. Bought on sale. Easy 10 minute setup to link with router. This a classic favorite of mine. Blu-ray makes it look so much better. So many classic lines with great actors. Not something to critique as a believable story line, but just a fun, romantic comedy. Disc extras are very cool too. The movie, Princess Mononoke, was fantastic. It became a family favorite as soon as it was watched. The movie was neither too long or too short, had a great storyline. Amazing animations and perfect ending. a great exclusive for the PS4, a lot of fun, the online gameplay is better than in CoD. The graphics are incredible, a lot of color and beautiful scenery. The use of the Dualshock 4 is innovative but in my opinion Sony has still not take full advantage of it although it is a very good start. I was not a huge fan of the Killzone series but this game changed my mind. This works perfectly for watching video on your IPAD on a TV . Works perfectly with Netflix, HBO Go, etc. No other comments needed! The product was good for the purpose is was bought. The price was right and work just fine.\n",
        "The only convenient is it has to be down as I wished it comes with a small stand to keep it up. The ipad mini with retina display is a little powerhouse. It powers up really fast, and the display is vibrant and clear. I don't use my laptop very much, because I can do just about everything with the ipad mini. I can search the web, play games, chat with friends. I don't need to worry about virus'\n",
        "I love this device. It's simply the classic story of the underdog against overwhelming odds. But yet, it's based loosely on a true story from before Indiana separated the high school basketball tournament into divisions, and all teams in the state participated to find the ACTUAL best team in the state. This game is a whole lot of fun! My 3 month old daughter enjoyed watching me play!! She cooed and played along with the music. Neil Blokamp also made District 9, which is probably a better overall movie. I still found Elysium to be the more entertaining of the two. Sharlto Copley definitely steals the show as the film's maniac villain. Always love donkey kong. Even better on the awesome wii u game system. Graphics rule and it's better than ever! It does a great job of protecting my phone. Not as bulky as my older OtterBox. Bought these Sony MDR-EX10LP to replace my Apple OEM iPad headphones. The sound quality is better than Apple's and the price could not have been better. The rich bass sound that's not overpowering, mixed with excellent high frequency treble, for my ears, makes for an optimal listen pleasure. Whether watching a movie on the iPad, listening to jams on the cell phone or streaming uTube videos on my laptop. Sony make a quality product and I'm extremely happy I purchased the headphones. The only drawback or complaint I have is the cord...yes, the length is industry standard, but 1 additional foot would make all the difference when you carry a backpack and have the cord wrapped around you back, wait and up to the ears. Great protection. The Kindle was a gift for a teenager so I wanted to make sure the screen was not damaged. Had a great sales person who didnt sway me one way or another,very happy witht how it works and that the company makes them and not just some random contractor If you're an adult who owns a Wii U, you probably bought the system because you love Nintendo games. And say what you will about the Wii U's sales performance, it already has some of the best Nintendo games ever; Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze is one of them. The presentation is fabulous (especially the music by original series composer David Wise), the level designs are wildly varied, and the whole game puts a smile on my face even when I'm getting my butt kicked.\n",
        "\n",
        "Speaking of which, the mainstream reviewers are right about the challenge--sort of. If you grew up playing 2D platformers in the 8- and 16-bit eras and this is too hard for you, I'm honestly not sure what to tell you; I'm by no means a champion gamer and I like cinematic experiences as much of the next guy, but I'm 5/6 of the way through and I haven't seen a single Game Over screen. At the same time, however, it is kind of a drag that a game as adorable as this is also undoubtedly way too difficult for most younger kids to play (and for some reason Nintendo has removed the \"Super Play\" or whatever mode that let the game play through tough sections for you after dying a certain amount of times). So despite the cute, kid-friendly presentation, this game really seems to be aimed at the generation of aging gamers who grew up with the original DKC games on the Super Nintendo.\n",
        "\n",
        "But if you're one of those aging gamers and you love platformers, this game should be high on your priority list. In fact, if you love platformers and you don't have a Wii U, you should consider changing that situation, because what the system lacks in quantity of games it's more than making up in quality of platformers. Between this, New Super Mario Bros/Super Luigi U, and DuckTales (with Rayman Legends and Mario 3D World on my \"to-buy\" list) the Wii U is basically my platformer machine; and quite frankly, when the games are this good, I'm OK with that! Quiet and has many different cycles. Gentle yet efficient cleaning. Stainless interior. I saw Gravity in the theater twice, both times IMAX 3-D. Only word can describe it: FANTASTIC. You not only think they are in space; you think you're in space with them!\n",
        "\n",
        "The cinematography is fantastic, the story well told, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. My wife is a huge fan of the dude who plays Thor. Movie was very entertaining even though some of the bad dudes are pretty cheesy. Very enjoyable over all but could have been better! These covers work as claimed. Easy install. Be patient. Any minor imperfections tend to go away in a few days... I use these to watch movies on my tablet while running on a treadmill. Works great. They stay in place. They do not block out the sounds from the outside though. This game has great graphics. A must if you love racing games! Thought the movie was really good. Good story line, it gets you sucked into the movie Great value and no set-up required. I like that the USB stick that connects to your computer is small so it doesn't get in the way ...but this is a downside also, especially since you can't attach a lanyard or anything to it--if you lose it, you're SOL.  Enjoy the case- protects tablet very well and easy to install. Nice laptop bag for the price and very easy to use. If you don't already have the individual Tesla albums on CD, this is a great compilation to pick up. Not bad for a protective cover. Somewhat cumbersome, but gets the job done. One of the best shows in a long time. The DVDs make watching it so much better. No commercial interruptions. Great flashdrive, tiny, key fob design is handy, easy to use, tons of storage space! I first watched this on a date. It's a perfect date movie. It's not too sappy, but still has a story that encourages some cuddling. I really enjoyed the music too, buying the soundtrack as well. I was surprised that the actors sang as well as they did. It's interesting the way they covered the familiar songs in a new way. Just how fast,the movie moves and the cinematgraphy was so great!!! I really like Pink concert, it's very entertaining and the concert is so live. This album is by far this best in Pink. As an avid fan of Bose, I decided on the SoundLink III after comparing it to the smaller Bose SoundLink Mini. I chose the SoundLink III for the longer battery life and my assumption that it would be louder &amp; be able to fill a bigger area with music. I am completely satisfied with my purchase, however I do wish it had the ability to be a bit louder. While it is loud enough to be a disturbance in a hotel room, outdoor use in a semi-noisy area isn't ideal. However, for portable speakers I shouldn't expect more. I love the large buttons on top of the speaker and how easy it is to connect via bluetooth. While I do think you could get a speaker that accomplishes the same task for a lesser price, trusting in Bose and knowing the quality/durability of previous products I've purchased has gained my loyalty. If you're deciding between this and the SoundLink Mini... go for this. It is just as easy to transport in my opinion, and I am a firm believer in \"go big or go home.\" The extra cost is worth it when you're making a purchase that will last you for years. I am a teacher and run many copies at home. THis printer and toner save me money Good love, science, drama movie. Good special effect. Also seen the attraction at Disney World. COLors are brilliant but the color cartridges seemto get used up so quickly. Their good for burning movies. I never had a problem with them on any of my DVD players. The only problem I have with them is the price for them. Everything you expect from a high quality next Gen shooter Bought them, used them, liked them. Still got a few left best deal for Epson ink, long lasting and great value Store had it in stock.....good price and it was easy to install!! Please overall! A+ if anyone is looking for a phone for protection and easy to access! The defender case is the way to go. Excellent and affordable tablet, better screen compare to other tablets. Easy to load movies and memory can be upgraded by purchasing a mini SD card. I would definitely recommend this for younger gamers. great product for a daily use and for business, easy to use and perfect size to travel Lens caps are easy to misplace or to get knocked off the camera. I suspect I will be replacing this lens cap with another just like it in the future. I really like this camera for the price. Has awesome megapixel for great prints Wonderful product. Works with all my memory cards (digital cameras and phones). Great price, too. I am very meticulous and was worried because when I first put the screen on it didn't look so great, but it turned out just fine after a couple days. Good memories of the disco era. Awesome reminder of the Bee Gees. I chose the colored bands so I could change things up depending on my wardrobe. I want to get a pink one next! Good in most ways but could have been a little better. Despite the two crashes I mentioned, this unit has been great. It's inexpensive, cute, and does its job well. Would definitely recommend this unit for someone who wants the TiVo experience throughout their home but without having to pay for multiple full DVR's. If you are a big fan of stealth game play, hiding in the shadows, planning out every move step by step, and of course that LOOT, then Thief is the game for you! Great story line from start to finish, it truly brings you into the game and makes you feel like a world class thief. Good flavor better than many of the other syrups by soda stream. I drink mostly soda water great tablet, just the right size. Haven't used my iPad since getting this tablet. Best part about this product is that my Samsung TV automatically connected to the sound bar. No need for any wires or HDMI cables. I like the look of the sound bar as well, you can see all the individual speakers. The sound quality is pretty good, price was nice, and it can fit anywhere. I bought this game for my kids cause they love lego's and the marvel charcaters I couldn't go wrong with this one it has all the big name heros great game The movie starts years after the first and it's like you never left. The plot is good and you love when the brothers join forces. Work in a warehouse and use my phone for music. Does not impede music and have dropped phone ans case holds up. Good movie but i think it could have had a better story, but the graphics were insane. Had to buy a new router to support about 8-10 devices at a time. This router fit the bill. Set-up was a breeze, very nearly \"plug 'n play.\" I am able to stream 3d video using Netflix and my ps3 without lag or load time.\n",

        "The only negative I have found so far is the range. I live in a small apartment and I only get 4 out of 5 reception bars on my living room TV, which is about 60 feet away with one wall in between. fit my needs perfectly. works well with all me devices Love the case but wish it was available for the older model iPads as well. So, I bought this movie specifically because I was depressed, going through a break up. Even in the depths of my despair, I found myself among and even laughing while watching. Sure, it's a sappy \"chick flick\", but sometimes that's just what you need. Great size and easy to use I also like the many accessories available for it as well The 3DS XL is great for those of us with less than perfect vision. I already have the regular 3DS, and treated myself to the larger-screened XL. I am so glad that I did! Really glad we went with this instead of the plasma. love the bright colors and the clarity. iPad air is my favorite tablet own a few different ones and this one is by far my favorite I've purchased for my two kids and my wife we all love the iPad air Store had the part.....good price and it works great! Easy installation, great reception, durable design. Love it I use these in my fitbit and they usually last a year. Really like Samsung televisions! Got this one for the bedroom. Loving it! Great quality speaker wire. Small strands, easy to run (not stiff). Little expensive, but worth it compared to some It's easy to set up and use. I love how the outcome of the photos. Quick and convenient. Highly recommend it all my friends. I picked this up on sale as a replacement at work and so far it works great. Since it is at work I cannot install any of the software but it still work fine, even the side buttons. My only minor complaint is the center scroll wheel is a little loud. Very good cordless mouse for the money. I love the Marvel movies!! I can't wait for more Super Hero movies!! product needs to tohave more clean up properties for average user I think that \"Thor: The Dark World\" was a great film with a lot of action and suspense. Natalie Portman and Kat Dennings were really amazing in this film. After getting a quote to install in wall speakers that was way too high, I turned my attention to internet wireless speakers. The reviews for the sonos looked too good to be true, I liked the sleek design and portability. In particular I liked the ability to pair 2 sonos to create stereo sound. I purchased 2 speakers and a bridge. We installed the speakers in our living room and played them for a party. The next day I tried to take them up to my office for some tunes. To my surprise, my wife came home after work and wanted the speakers back in the living room....she loved them! We listen to music every night with these speakers. A great investment. great price, keyboard is awesome, doesn't have anything you don't need\n",
        "Not flashy but good phone for thr price Must have for any xbox owner. Play online with friends or tournments Great for anyone but me, who likes to play on my iphone while jogging. Its really a wonderful product for fellow joggers who listen to music, just plug in your earphones, and your hands free, well, most people are handsfree, if I didn't play with the buttons constantly My family and I enjoyed this movie very much! Glad it came out this soon, Product worked great right out of the box. Picture quality is great, sound is OK. I immediately hooked the TV to surround sound so I don't know alot about the sound quality. Great Price! Excellent headphones , most comfortable , noise cancellation is at great level. I refer this one to everyone. thank you ! I'm glad it was on sale and I was able to buy this for my daughter nice speakers for the price\n",
        "excellent quality...uncompromising sound quality I suggested the tablet for my mother who has never used anything with the android operating system. I was able to basically walk her through every step to get her up and running. One of the best movies that I saw all year. Wish I had seen it in the movies in three D. Sandra bullock was very convincing in this role. I like the combo pack option for the colt cartridges. These are not the cheapest to buy but they are well made and will save time on installation. Simple Xbox 360 wireless controller. I only paid $15 dollars for it thanks to best buys price matching.\n",

        "Item as in new condition and works as expected. I love mythology characters come to life! Great movie for all ages! I haven't had this very long, but it seems to be filtering the room pretty well. I like that the filter is washable as I had to toss my last one because they quit making it and the filters. good item, compact, nice looking, really happy with my purchase marvel has hit a home run with the avengers characters This was a great movie, to prove that certain ethics, and values always pay off. It is also great to see the conflict in the story. Excellent tablet for my 6 year old son. He does his homework, and his speech app daily. The movie was very good. Blue ray version was good on my big tv Upgraded from iPad 2 to gain more memory and lose some weight. Very satisfied. Maybe not as good as the first three seasons, but that is still heads and shoulders above the vast majority of shows out there. I only wish the number of episodes for the season were more than they are - can't get enough of them! Love otterbox cases but I wish this one had the built in magnets to turn the ipad on\\off. great if you want to stay with orginial equipment,seems to run out quickly Bought this for my lil nephew and he enjoys watching it As the event that started the beloved TV series it's a great place to understand where the characters started from. And, even if it's not the same actors, seeing the characters again was wonderful. great for anybody who loves super hero movies, its filled action, comedy, and did I mention action... lol The characters were awesome and new faces just what the movies need I needed a new phone as my old iPhone 4S was full and having issues with sound. The new one is so much nicer! The size is great, thinner so it fits in my pocket or purse easier. Plus I love the touch-to-unlock feature. The movie was very good. Blue ray version was good on my big tv come home from a hard day of work ,relax enjoy this I realy like it but I have 14 speakers in my house so its is going to take to many of these to run all of them. It seems batteries are needed now days for everything, and these are the best, never leave the store without them. I bought this for my daughter because she kept borrowing my samsung 10.1 tablet. She loves it because it is easy to use and small to carry. She can also create her own email address and go on the internet. She found asite to order books to read and Iis able to use Iit Iin school. I loved this movie. Action packed and it was so clear on blueray. Best gift my son got for Xmas! He loves the sound and the way they stay on. i needed a new holder for my GPS since i just recently bought the bean bag holder for my garmin. it holds my GPS put the holder and some other thing I am very pleased with this purchase. It does everything well and is pretty easy to use. I have had this dryer about 1 month and it is a proven winner! I had this for PS3 and loved it so much I couldn't wait to play it again with updated graphics. Same amazing gameplay and story, the updated graphics for PS4 are incredible. Love it!! By far the best Terminator. Absolutely love the Skynet Edition and it's special features. Screen was easy to install, and stays put. A+++++++++++++++++++++++++ My daughter and i enjoyed this film as we saw Cloudy Meatball Part 1. We loved it. Hope they make the third film, the first two movies were great. Bought this TV when our 12 year old Magnavox's picture tube started to develop horizontal lines at the top of the screen. Knew it was time for a new one. Paid for the installation, set-up and haul-off of the old TV so there wouldn't be technical difficulties and we wouldn't have to pay the landfill for disposal. Technicians delivered the product even earlier than expected, were very professional. Works fine, fits our existing TV armoire. Wonder how much better a 120 hz TV could be?  Control everything from your iphone or your iPad to your tv. Not only was the casting done right (the BEST) but the historical accuracy was spot on! Loved all the extras that this 30th Anniversary edition included. This film picked up 4 Academy Awards for sound, score, editing and best sound effects! Actually, I must express the fact that I am beyond disappointed, although this is certainly not the manner in which I would prefer to submit a review. I, conversely to my usual reviews in which I furnish extensively helpful details, highly favorable product and service feedback, find this necessity to concur with many other customer's negative reviews on this same product to be regrettable. This is unlike a previous purchase of EforCity HDMI cables, at an incredibly low price, which accompanied my HDTV order. The salesperson's suggestion to include this specific cable with my recent order, related to a computer and accessories, proves incorrect and incompatible for the basic purpose. This salesperson, along with said issue, caused a rather serious situation with her other error to proceed in charging a card, which happened to still be on file, while I actually provided to her a totally different card as payment for my recent order. However, as is entirely pertinent to this VGA to HDMI cable, it does not accurately fit my computer model and, to that end alone, proves an unsatisfactory product. In all fairness, I do genuinely appreciate that, in comparison to prior purchases of EforCity HDMI cables, the quality is equal to those rather pricey, fancy brand-name cables, yet these cables are at an impressively reasonable price. Indeed, with very low pricing -just a small fraction of popular brand-names- their cables are ordinarily up to excellently manufactured standards. Even though it's unacceptable for any cable to not work for the basic purpose it was alleged to, perhaps running this risk almost balances out when considering the benefits that are generally experienced of ordering and receiving those other great cables at a very nice price. This multi pack cartridge was extremely easy to install. My only gripe is that my printer calls for an additional cartridge that is not included. I had to purchase it separately. I wasnt aware of the extra cartridge until installation began. This prompted another trip to store. Interesting story line, however the acting is a little cheesy, and the cinematography could be better. Our whole family loves to play infinity!! So excited to have the Mickey figure in the game! I suggest everyone should watch this show! It is awesome! We have a small play room &amp; this helps us be able to play out Kinect games with no problems. The film is amazing. A true must see. I'm not a fan of Bullock, so that was my only real gripe. The sound is great and so is the color but It really looks way to bulky on your head. IT looks like a football helmet face mask Lana Del Rey. What I like about this album is the hip-hop influenced beats. I feel it gets me moving. Lana's voice is haunting and one that I feel we don't have on the radio so her uniqueness is refreshing to me. What can I say, I like her sound and this album! Great monitor, way better then Mac. I was initially going to buy the mac screen but decided to go with the Dell. Im glad I went with this choice because I saved like 400 bucks. 3D graphics are ok, the plot gets kind of confusing. Not as good as the first time but for a sequel is ok. Canon Printers are the best Printers that I have used. this battery charger is so reliable and also great for travelling it is a must also in every household for every day uses , in garage, and also light, compact and a perfect partner for tools utilizing batt. now I nerver run out of batt power supply and if ever this product works fast in charging different brand of batteries If you want a dedicated music player with lots of space then this is pretty much the only option. The smartphone effectively killed off the mp3 player market. I like to have a dedicated player for a number of reasons but one of them being is I don't want to run down my phone's battery seeing how it's pretty bad as it is. The ipod Classic has great battery life and it's perfect for when I travel. In summary: if you need lots of space to carry your music collection with you, this is the one. While die hard fans of the comic maybe upset by the changes to Peter Parker's life. The plot holds together well and still feels like a story in cannon. Builds a solid foundation for the trilogy to come. A great take on the X-Men universe after the horror that was X3. Worth a watch for any X-Man fan. A good adaptation of the book even if they had to take liberties with the material. I love this phone!! It takes great pictures. Better than my digital camera and better than the Galaxy S3 I had. The battery lasts longer than my old S3 did as well. I think every house hold should own this spectacular movie. It has a ton of singing but it is an unbelievable movie. Getting this as a gift avoids the problem of getting a game you really weren't interested in. This gift card allows you to download games of your preference. This is especially beneficial if you also subscribe to Playstation Plus since you will get more bang for your buck. If your shopping for a gamer, take the guess work of trying to find the right game for them and get them this card instead. Guitar sound 15-23456, there are a few bad ones. So drained away. there's a reason why it was Oscar nominated, however after staring too long into space it gets kinda boring. Good 3D graphics, ok plot. I've been looking for an affordable blender and this one isn't only affordable it does the job better than most expensive blenders. The movie itself really makes Thor a significant part of The Avengers and shows a great contrast with the Loki of previous films. The bonus features are lacking much more than previous MCU films. Can mute without moving your hand off the shifter. I've been looking for a great Vaccum and this one has def done the job well! This is the first album I have bought from these guys. I bought it because I heard one of the songs and the lead singer was on an album by For Today. As soon as I started listening to this I was blown away! The music is so precise. The lyrics are really deep and the way they are sang/screamed is amazing. You should buy this album now. speakers sound great. sub even sounds good for being small. definitely worth the investment. The movie itself was solid and the twist will affect how you feel if you're a fanboy or not. The package itself is wonderful and include a myriad of special features. funny, funny....big fan of Reese Witherspoon (HOTTIE), Chris Pine awesome High capacity flash drive for a bargain! Easy to use with a nice protective cover. It was on sale when I purchased it, so it was an even cheaper price! good continuation of the original story line, good character growth this is great you know how much cash you have , also if you don't feel good about having a credit card out there this work. I purchased this camera after a great deal of research. I was looking for a good camera that would be a step up from a point and shoot/camera phone. I was first impressed by the size of this camera. It is the smallest DSLR camera I have found. It is essentially no larger than many of the popular mirror-less cameras I looked at. This camera has almost all the essential feature of the larger EOS models. I was impressed with the overall build quality and handling of the SL1. The STM lens included is very good for the price point. I have tried a few other brands, and it was not as easy to place. I bought the go pro wall charger just to use reward points. Now I love it! I never remembered to plug in my GoPros when I was on the computer and actually bought a genetic charger. I was afraid to use it but the genuine GoPro product gave me peace of mind (and fully charged batteries)! It seems that most people are 50/50 on this movie! I thought the filming was great the special effects even better! It walked a very thin line from science to science fiction! I watched the movie two days before I visited the Kennedy Space Center LOL! Kinda very me a new respect for the individuals that go up there and the people that support them! Overall the Blu-ray experience with this product was excellent! I loved all the extras they threw on the this disc. The negative; I wished it was itunes friendly not NOT Ultraviolet. This is hands down the highest quality/best 3rd party controller available for PS3. Definitely worth the $. I can see why they are difficult to find in the stores. Great sound quality for the price. Too bad it doesn't last longer, breaks after 6-8 months. Traditional NASCAR game at its finest. I love the gameplay and find myself playing more often than I thought I would. Definitely would recommend this to anyone interested in racing. Awesome picture quality.\n",
        "Couldn't resist to notice how natural the colors are even with comparison to other monitors on display. The picture on the display in the store was fairly dim, but I talked to the sales person, and it was right out of the box using factory settings. I was pretty sure that I could make it look better, and I was right. The only thing I did was jack up the brightness setting and man was I happy with the picture. I know it's only 720p, but wow...it looks great! I love the media player...I plugged my hard drive with my media on it into the usb port and it played my movies with no problem. I am extremely happy with this purchase. Performs as expected. Simple to set up and use. I would recommend this to others I love that Canon has made a camera in the color purple. Just the color alone, sold me on the product. Canon is known for being the best quality easy use camera. I didn't like Nikon. Canon features are great and easy to find. I am sticking with Canon. All these Marvel movies/characters are my favorite. Thor is similar to Superman - coming to Earth from another place. Thor is one of the ultimate greats! Works great.\n",
        "Quick install on its own so there is no need to worry about having to install it.\n",
        "Good battery life so far.\n",
        "Could come up with a better design for the mouse. If you play or love american folk music, this is for you. Great performances both musically and theatrical. Some classic scenes that you will never forget. All around enjoyable film. I like to watch a lot of different TV shows and Breaking Bad is by Far......The Best Show!!!! Been looking at this HD tv for quite some time. Love Samsung picture quality. Works perfectly with my Apple tv. Gives heart beat, calories burned seem acurate, I like how it send my HB 2 tradmills, elipticals, and other machines. I feel like if the company advertised this product it would do a lot better than it already does. I have followed this series from the beginning and enjoy watching it at my leisure. GREAT,i love it good for streaming from any apple product. The game is great, has great graphics, and a great new take on the pvz title. The game feels short because everything is unlocked almost immediately... overall: 8/10 This is the first Mario Kart game that I owned and I love it. My family has a lot of fun playing this game. product is great , the price is better all the other streamers cost at least 100.00 bucks and they aren't that great this one is. It's easy to use and easier to operate Printer inks are basic for a device like this one, so, if you need to install one on your printer and do not want to have any problems at all, you need to install HP cartriges, they are not too cheap, but they will not give you problems and will last longer. Slash a way the stress of the day. Don't recommend for kids. Great price for a season of an HBO miniseries was my first thought! Lots of great extras to break up the season or to watch at the end! Overall quality and value is EXCELLENT! Took some time to get all the data off of itunes but now I can icloud any episode anywhere I have wifi to my ipad mini! The sound is great I think that they are worth the money Bottom line, it does what it is meant to do. The cons, it is tight when trying to put on or remove, and the product was just naturally a lot more expensive than what it should be. Picked up this hard drive after building my own pc and finding out my old hard drive was not being read in new system. I used the pre exsisting holes where it would normally screw in to put it in a quick expansion bay. Slid it in plugged in sata cable and was in business. I would say that if anyone is looking for an upgrade from an old iPhone, then this is definitely it. unfortunately the screen size is not too big, but big enough to notice. I would say that it is exactly what i needed in a phone. If the price were cheaper, it would be even better. But i cannot complain, especially if i used a lot of gift cards to buy this. My daughter absolutely loved this movie. She can't stop watching this movie and I think it's been on tv everyday. I like the ink I have used it before it prints out good. Overall I am very happy with my Tracfone ZTE Valet . Attractive case. Does it's job., and was on clearance! This vacuum is flat out awesome! Its lightweight and easily maneuvers into most areas that a traditional upright can't. The only downfall I've found is that the only standard attachment is a small crevace tool. I wish it would have come with a brush attachment for pet hair as many other uprights do now. Giving up a little bit of a heavy duty case for this style was ok with me. I love this game, just wanted to add more characters to the game!! I love it! I play the games all the time!! I just wanted to add more characters! I get cheaper games and some free games!! I love it. Have not had any problems, quiet, so far as so good. Good value for price I read the 5C was a cheap version, and it's anything but.\n",
        "Very happy with my purchase. It great and it protect my tablet, and I like the way it looks and also its black and it look professional!! Bought the game because I like the series and this game didn't fail me. Easy to operate with remote....great sound...love the flashing lights Ease of access. I can navigate it without instruction. Been wanting a Samsung for a while and I couldn't beat the price and plan. I was looking to replace old worn out pots/pans and these fit the bill.No problems with them, I just wash by hand and they stay as good as new. This color is really nice and cute!!! The case fits the iPad Air very well. I like being able to switch between types of uses, but display on front for programming is too hard to read, too small. The manual is a little confusing as well. So far this is by far the best device out there in this size range. No problems with it at all. Hilarious! Better than the first movies! My daughter simply loves it and will watch the entire movie! Superior sound, volume and clarity appropriate for use on the highway. Easy to turn on and off. Holds charge well. Ear piece takes getting used to. This Humidifier looks cute and it works great. The only two complains are its price and the need for frequent cleaning. Otherwise substance will accumulate on the base and makes it hard to clean. I have enjoyed the set (washer and dryer). Dryer doesn't bake your clothes, Both appear to make less noise than the older models. The picture quality is amazing, The image has a 3D quality to it which I didn't see in other brands. Easy set up, Image looked perfect out of the box. No additional fine tuning necessary. Even at a low level, the sound is more than loud enough for my room size. Went back and bought a second one! Didn't know if it would be as good as Monsters Inc, was just as enjoyable. The game was only $40 when it first released and will only get cheaper over time. It uses the same engine as Battlefield 4 but has none of the glitches that Battlefield suffers from.\n",
        "\n",
        "Solid game with a unique class-based multiplayer. I wasn't sure about Chromecast for a while, but friends persuaded me to go ahead and give it a whirl. And for $35, I didn't think it'd be too much of a risk.\n",
        "I'm glad I did. I love being able to stream from my iPhone or my laptop with relative ease. Great for sharing videos, pictures, youTube content, and web pages through Google Chrome.\n",
        "Could be compatible with more apps in iOS. Hopefully more items will be added in the not so distant future, like other music sources outside of Pandora.\n",
        "All in all, it's a great value. This is a must have for any smartphone, tablet or any kind of electronic device you have. The quality is great, you will never even know it is there. I use my memory card with my camcorder and have only used it a dozen times or so but have had no problems with it. My only complaint is that the memory card did not come with a storage case (in case I don't have it in my camcorder and want to store it without scratching it). it's a good thriller movie, kinda expected it to be much better, but it was alright. I really loved this movie, you won't regret watching it. Its a good tablet for everyday use. I can play games and surf the web with ease while being able to read books and watch movies. This was an incredible series with a Wonderful Actor in Andy Whitfield. HE is sorely missed, but created an unforgettable character This Amplified HDMI Splitter is exactly what I was looking for.\n",
        "I needed to be able to connect both my TV and Surround Sound to my Dish Receiver, but the surround system I have does not have an optical input; only HDMI. I was worried that I wasn't going to be able to have the option of using either my TV volume alone or have to use the Surround Sound any time the TV was on.\n",
        "This amplified splitter was the perfect solution to my needs without having to buy an expensive optical to HDMI converter.\n",
        "Very happy with this piece, and it's a great product with an even better price tag. one of the best comedy movies that I've ever watched. Very easy game to play . great game .\n",
        "Kids can play easily .  I bought them for use in the gym, and I have to admit that they are not the best for in the gym. The ear cups are leather, they get pretty wet due to sweat. That's really it. They sound better than any wired headphones I've ever owned. The range isn't the best, best to keep device near by. I enjoyed this entire series tremendously. Good way to introduce characters from the beginning The NetGear is a nice product. I have been able to do exactly what I wanted to. The fast speed of the processor with the 8gb ram really lets me multitask with no problems. The touch screen display is very responsive. Someone has obviously figured a way to produce a very high quality of woofing at a very competitive price. Gotta love that combo. Now the real test of value will be determined by the length of time it will still function. I am a big fan of Romeo. Go to every concert when he is in Houston. Have Formula 1 and Formula 2 was a must. It is an awesome CD. Love the lyrics and the beats. All in all its awesome!! What can I say Romeo is good with his words. This is a must have. Less than 10 minutes to install and set security. Additional warranty available at a low cost. this computer comes with most of the programs you will ever need The Keyboard Cover for Apple iPad mini helps my little brother use the key board, like a computer for typeing. While it keeps the mini somewhat protected. I got this for my son and he loves it. He watches it at least once a month. I got this for my wife and she loves it. This was one of her favorite shows. She has watched it several times already. This was a nice twist on zombie movies that added a love story. A change to seeing all the horror zombie movie out there lately. Thankful for the Blu-ray releases for this show since it is no longer on Starz. One of the best series ever Frozen is a great movie. My kids ask for it all the time. I really like the new digital copy program. We redeemed our title on Amazon, and now we can watch it on our Kindle Fires, TVs, Playstation, etc. This iPod works great. The only thing I would change is to spend the extra to get the 32GB version with the rear camera. bought on a whim but i totally love it. easy to use and takes quick shots and love that its compatible with my Ps3. only drawback is no Black and white setting and not many filters. The morphie was a very good purchase, especially for on the go. Tried the refillable ink cartridges. They were awful. A waist. This HP woks great every time. We love our new vacuum. All the attachments and the way it gets up the cat hair is awesome. Easy to use, clean, looks nice too. Would definitely recommend this product. I like it because it fits in my pocket without feeling too big. It is durable and still provides protection. I like that you can still see the color of the phone when it is on. Compared to all the other phone cases, the price is decent. It is very simple. My special needs son uses them on the bus to school. First time headphones have lasted over a month. Decent sequel and a must own in the continuing Marvel universe of movies. The short \"Hail to the King\" is also great. This was a good purchase. I had to drive myself to a complicated area in Miami. did so successfully. And more than that. I returned home without getting lost. The Mophie charger is a great asset for my iPhone 5. Before I brought the charger my iPhone was always dead and now I have a back up. My son (Sergio) loves his new phone. I have not seem him so happy in a long time:) Overall it is an excellent machine! It's fast, easy to use, and has been reliable since I bought it a month ago. My only issue is that there is some glare on the screen from the sun as I keep it in a bright room. It is also prone to fingerprints on the glossy screen so I have to clean it regularly. Perfect for making a backup for a safety deposit box... at a price that doesn't break the bank! This is a great, inexpensive simple case. I purchased case after my almost $100 lifeproof case broke, just to have a case while getting a LP replacement. I have yet to get a replacement and this case is holding up well. It may not be water or dust proof, but it does job of keeping my phone in one piece. I would recommend this phone to everyone. I like everything about this phone. Easy to read navigate. I like the large screen easier to touch since I have large fingers. And I can make things larger if need be. I recommend this product to people who are into \"bumping\" there music. It sounds awesome. And was a great deal Good tough case. Looks great. Very functional. Would buy again. Fits perfectly. I had no problems inthe installation and the reception thru-out the house is great. This cd had a lot of songs that I liked and the ones I didn't know I am liking too! This was a great value for counter depth frig w/ a stainless steel finish. Waited to see this on Blu-Ray and could not have been happier. Great Sequel and a good way to continue Phase 2 in the Marvel Universe Like most Apple devices, I found the Apple Air to be very reliable. Very lightweight with enough power to do everything I need it to whether on the road or at home. good free item, backpack would be better to use if have more than 2 lens., if not works well. These ink refills are easy to install and print well. A little bit more expensive than the other brand. Worth the cost for the difference it made in the sound quality. Will continue to buy this brand for future needs. Great fun and easy to navigate. Games are fun and real life. Love how the camera and mic work with the games. Received has cardboard material (dirty) on lens but not scratches on it blew right off. But this item for your camera improves picture Had a Asus tablet. It was okay but lacking in many areas. Apple products just work and are easy to use. i went from a fat-back (ha!) 200-pound 30\" sony to this sharp 50\", and i am loving it! picture is great. sound is fine, but i will probably get a sound bar eventually. connected a sony smart wi-fi blu-ray player, and life is good! I was leery of leaving my iPhone behind, but in the end I am not missing it as much as I thought. i liked this movie it had good action good comedy ! I bought this humidifier to replace an older model that lived it's life, but it was time to retire.\n",
        "I searched many models to compare water capacity, hot vs cold steam, output capacity, and of course price.\n",
        "This seemed to be the best bang for the buck and it hasn't disappointed me whatsoever.\n",
        "Sure, it's not the top of the line, doesn't have a fancy remote or digital control panel, but this unit does it's intended job superbly and doesn't look out of place with my decor. Definitely a great value. I'd recommend this to anyone looking to keep your home comfortable and static- free. overall a buy for price, looks, and performance. Although the brand is considered low end, this one meets Consumer Products expectations. Great price, keeps photos safe, preforms well don't need to spend more for a faster card. Camera has own internal memory so don't waste money on faster 95mbps speed. The sound bar wall mount attachment is great especially if you have a Samsung TV It holds my iPhone in front of the dashboard where I can see it while driving and using it as a GPS. I clipped it to the vents of my '06 Focus so it would be convenient to the power socket and my charger. But it's not easy to remove the mount, so it has to be there always, even when it isn't needed. That also makes it too much of a nuisance to check out the alternate suction cup mount. BUT, I must emphasize that it does do its intended task very well. The grandkids played it over a couple of times. They really got into the movie. The little ones really were excited. the rock is as always great actor i always watch his movies This is definitely an interesting take on the style and life of two juggernauts in the tech world. More than I expected.I am able to get face expressions before they are gone. Fast shutter speed. lens provide is very good. Added another lens to get more distance fro scenery photos.. The Samsung sound bar is great and has amazing sound but the price is a little expensive I was pleasantly surprised by this movie as usually sequels are not as good as the first, however this one did a great job of continuing the story of Thor. Great materials and sound construction. Works well. great movie, from start to end\n",
        "better then the first\n",
        "amazing stunts , This movie is so funny and I love how it shines a light on how the life of a role playing geek has to deal with his parents who don't accept him since he doesn't do sports. its just the right length and its made good quaulity As good if not better then the first.\n",
        "great stunts, great action must see movie I bought this TV for my bedroom not thinking that I would need more than 2 HDMI ports but it wasn't that big of a deal as I just bought a switch that can handle up to 5. The picture is quality as you wouldn't expect anything less from a Samsung TV. This 32GB SanDisk Pixtor microSDHC memory card has been tested to withstand extreme operating conditions, such as temperatures between -13\u00b0 and 185\u00b0, shocks up to 500Gs and water up to 1m deep, to enable use in a variety of harsh environments. Great movie, fast pace , great action,\n",
        "enjoyed very much buy the filter lens! Great Lens, Easy to use in auto and manual mode, but you will need a UV filter lens especially in manual mode. This was an awesome game. Better than the last one. screen should flip out and hide like the Nikon D5200 Makes installing your dishwasher very easy. First in our case! This OtterBox Defender case features 3 layers of protection, including a high-impact polycarbonate shell, a silicone skin and a thermal-formed clear membrane, to help safeguard my Samsung Galaxy S 4 mobile phone against damage. It is a good google product for $35.00 it good for Netflix. Great holiday movie great cast wonderful plot see it Great characters, very interesting plot twists. Worth every penny. I bought a Chromecast media player for my daughter as a Christmas gift, and quickly realized what a great addition it would be to our entertainment toolkit. Particularly great for travel to hotels where we can now watch videos accessed from our iPhone to play on a TV with HDMI port no matter where we are traveling. Nice! My husband loves this product. He makes breakfast sandwiches for all of us and they are delicious. He wishes that they would make a double sandwich maker. I recently used this memory card on a cruise and took many, many photographs. This card worked well and I didn't have any issues with it. I've already downloaded from it and once again woks well. I really enjoy the music from this group since they don't record anymore. I just wish there would have been a couple other songs on it that were popular. Really enjoyed the game, good story, cool graphics, and character powers and abilities, added bonus was the paper trail. Love this gadget!! Easy refill and soap squeezes right out. I really like the fitbit flex. It's easy to use. Syncs with no use connection like my first fit bit and is waterproof. The printer was a great buy. Clear photos, two sided papers available and its wireless. Perfect for a student. This music artist is great at what he does! It good country music with some county-rock. I have being playing the Rayman Games since I got the Playstation 1! Although I have not been able to play all of them, Rayman Legends definitely exceeded my expectations from the ones I have played. Not only were the graphics and audio awesome, but the storyline and side games are a ton of fun! There are so many different opportunities for game play from the normal storyline to the daily or weekly challenges to the new levels added when you pass a level. I love the game and would definitely recommend it to anyone for both or either single and multiplayer gameplay! My only issue is that you cannot make or save multiple files but overall great game! This was a gift for my 23 year old daughter. She didn't want a Smart TV. Now, she's so happy that I talked her into it!! She loves listening to her music or watching Netflix at the push of a button. This is great for converting those old home movies from VHS to DVD!! I installed this yesterday and found the construction very good and the packaging excellent. This was my first wall mount installation and I was pleased that there was plenty of extra hardware accommodating a lot of variable options (mine was one of them) and the instructions were clear and easy to follow.\n",
        "\n",
        "The only shortcoming was the wall brackets. As noted by others, it was designed for 16\" studs, but that assumes that the center of the desired TV location is someplace between the studs. In my case the center was directly over the stud so when pushed flat to the wall it is not/cannot be centered. All they needed to do was add a few inches to these two brackets to make this product perfect. Somebody needs to fire their cost accountant and listen to their customers (maybe read a review or two). Once pulled out a few inches it easily centers, but this is less than perfect for a premium mount that costs this much. Hell, give me an accessory option to buy longer brackets for $20 and call it a day.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall I am very pleased with this mount and would consider Chief products the next time.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you are considering this product and need to be flat to the wall make sure that you locate your studs first and make sure that the desired center is 6 to 8\" between your studs. If that is the case you will love the mount, if not you will not be happy. It's a very good washer . It's big through the inside . Has enough space to wash big loads of clothes . Very easy to use and handle . I would recommend this washer for a big family . This is a good, but gritty movie about the realities of dealing with the terrorist world. Though not as sophisticated as westerners, their labyrinth of cloak and dagger operations poses great challenge for those who seek to foil their plans.\n",
        "This movie takes you inside without all of the Hollywood drama and sensationalism. It takes you along on their journey. I'm wondering if this movie was made recent years, How much better movie to enjoy with today's technology, and special effects. Awesome product, but a bit pricey. The cable is made of good construction I like it because I can look at my progress on the minute. It calculates calories burnt as well as calories gained and will adjust for exercise how many calories you can still consume that day. For who likes a real coffee this is it! Taste and smell as a high quality European style! This soundbar is great!! Easy hookup and great sound!! Super glad this game stayed to its roots but also changed the right parts to make it fresh and amazing. Worth every penny! The xbox one is a great gaming system, it is expensive up-front but if you use all of the features it is worth the money. The technology enhancement with the kinect is worth the money alone. Great apps, including the snap app to split the screen between two apps at once. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the purchase. Wasn't sure if I wanted a prepaid phone but I was very pleased after I bought it. Turned out to have all the same features as a regular contract phone. Glad I made the choice of getting it. Great case for the price paid. I recommend getting a sticky screen protector to further protect your phone from scratches. Great for business minded people. I will only buy a HP printer that has this ink because it's the best. I do a lot of printing for work, etc. and I need a cartridge that will suffice. The worst thing is to get a cartridge that doesn't produce enough and I have to keep buying more frequently. This cartridge does the trick for me. You just can't stop watching it. Every episode is movie quality. If your bored with a character they probably die soon, if your loving a character they may be dead soon. If you can't remember who they are they'll definently be dead soon, it's a win win situation. I say more fun than reading the books, but if you've read the books you'll still be surprised. Improved battery life and the next generation towards replacing laptops! Good movie, Great retro movie and fun acting. Worth your time.  From the moment I bought it I haven't taken it off my IPad, spectacular performance Keeping with the success the Peter Jackson did with The Lord of the Rings, this movie is great fun and keeps you on your toes while letting you connect with the characters. And it does a decent job of staying true to the book. This second movies in the series holds up with the first. If you liked the first one you'll enjoy the second. I followed many reviews of this TV, and finally I got one. The Samsung reputation and the way this one impresses me means I'll probably get another Samsung. It is perfect for the room where I have it. Greta product I can have my printer sitting where it is compatible with my space. I have been please with this washing machine so far. I love how big a load of clothes I can wash. It picks the level of water it needs also. Seems to take a while to run a cycle but overall I really am pleased. Seems a good game for older kids, but the young ones always want to play If your looking for a good movie to watch in 3D this one will entertain you. This is an excellent movie. Stays true to the book. I was surprised to see this type of hose. But after using my washer for the past few weeks, I think they are great. Holds alot of photos and do not need to carry another disk. This is a nice cross for those who want a tablet with a little more power Love the product. The sound is great for a 2.1 system. Even when sound is turned up to max, music/movies still sounds clear. I have always bought this brand for 3 iphones i have had. also, bought for my kids ipads as well. They last the life of my phone...never ever had to replace any of them. Great protection for the screen. I highly recommend this brand! Controller is nice. Easy to handle and play games with. Would recommend to others. Would like to have found a female option of the same product or an option for small buds that insert into the ear. They are a bit too large for my ear but they stay in place while I am running which is an improvement over the product I was using. It's still a good game series and it will continue to keep you playing, new modes and challenges keep the game interesting. Should pick it up if you haven't for the last gen. I really like this game. Would recommend to others. This case is by far the best i have had for all my iphones. It is made of great material and protects my iphone so nicely. looks sleek too. i highly recommend gettng it to protect your investment! This is a very nice looking component shelf. The tinted glass that makes up the shelf is thick and durable, and looks great. The unit was easy to install with easy-to-follow instructions, and feels like it could hold a pretty decent amount of weight. This is a great cable to use for any purpose, hasnt slowed down the speed of charging my phone, tablet, or iPod, and hasnt slowed down any transfer speeds either. I am very pleased with this computer great price !! best charger on the market as of now for XBOB ONE and XBOX360. Charges quickly and efficiently, and also has led lights to let u know condition of battery on charger in a tier formation. Looks rather nice in the dark Wonderful plot from the beginning. Keeps you on your toes through the whole movie. There are cheaper and more expensive wall mounts for flat screens, but this one fit my needs exactly. It is a two person job to install in reality, but took 30 - 60 minutes to do so. The instructions are very easy to follow, and the mount is very sturdy. It's easy to adjust once it is mounted, and sits flush enough to the wall that I can still walk past my bed that's barely more than 2 feet from the wall. This is a great TV for bedroom purposes but wish the remote would light up for easy access to volume, channels, on/off (just the simple use). I am a big fan of the combat and mechanics of all the infamous games and it really was fun to play a game for the ps4 that made good use of the touchpad and speaker of the ps4 controller. The open world of second son is awesome. The story was a bland also the new character a little disappointing. Perhaps the I am just getting tired of video games use of the morality gimmick. All in all though this is the most fun game I have played for the new ps4. The control feel a litrle lighter and i like the new shared button. I considered myself a bit spoiled having had an original pair of Legacy II speakers. They were starting to show their age so I shopped for some speakers that might be close to these. I went in considering the B&amp;W's but something didn't quite strike me about the sound of them. I asked the salesman to give the Motion 40's a go. Using one of my CD's, it hit a key sonic moment that hit me that these were the ones. I tried a couple of other music sources and genres and was still pleased with the sound.\n",
        "\n",
        "I then found out they were 4 ohm speakers but that they would work on up to 8-ohm receivers. My receiver is rated 6-16 ohms and has not been a problem. Excellent speakers! I would recommend this product to anyone looking for centalized storage and distribution of home media. It does not include sufficient apps for students to use in doing their assignments for collage. They have to pay additional money to obtain necessary apps. In addition, the bag for MacBook is great, looking modest and professional. Also, it's easy to carry it while MacBook is in. Performs well for everyday use of internet and cable in my apartment. I have been extremely pleased with the Galaxy Tab 3 10.1. The features have been easy to use, especially since they are the same as the Samsung Galaxy phones. I enjoy being able to have multiple applications, such as the NOOK app and the Amazon Kindle app, without having to have multiple pieces of equipment. This tablet really is a versatile tool. I bought this for my little bro. He loves as i do. Got a great deal on this computer and I absolutely love it. Hands down better than the PC I used to own Overall a good game and product but the game needs a few minor tweakings such as aloowing the gamer to customize more things as well as having the option to just go to a race instead of always having to drive everywhere. easy to operate. customer service was Very helpful with trandaction. We use this camera for skype interviews with vendors and physicians. Great camera! Face tracking feature is nice. This was a great buy and I hope to find more like it down the road. This is an excellent CD with many familiar Disney songs. Little ones love to sing along! This program has been excellent. It is always checking and catching things. Not too mention it is not labor intensive on CPU so it can run smooth in background. Love it and so worth the purchase. I purchased this for my wife and we both love it. She was working on a web based scrapbooking project for her father and wanted her siblings to see what was going on and give input with out sitting over her shoulder on the laptop. This could have been accomplished with a long HDMI cable and a mirrored screen setup but the Chromecast at $30 was not much more than an HDMI cable. Works great with Chrome, Netflix, and Pandora. I believe it works with Hulu although I have not tried. I know that Google has opened the sourcecode up and more apps and programs will be able to cast. I would buy another for my old upstairs TV if only it had an HDMI port. This was one of those win win movies. Good acting and good storyline that matched the blockbuster FX. Usually with movies that are big on FX, the story and acting don't live up to the hype. This one did. I only had to pull it out of the packaging and it was ready to go with my galaxy s4. Works well for price. I would definitely re-purchase.. Easy to use, easy set up. I used it to connect my cable box to my internet and it has worked great. This item is great for the price charged; would recommend. This tv is a grab value, has very good quality very nice picture. Great product, I have never had issues with this product 4GB memory card fit perfectly into my Garmin GPS which was necessary to receive new expanded map updates. The GPS unit would not have been operational without the 4GB memory card. Bought this laptop when i found out i was going on a deployment. This laptop helps me to keep in touch with my family. The screen resolution is awesome. The speed/memory of the is laptop is the best i have every had. Well worth the cost. Purchased this since I upgraded to a faster internet service. The old modem would only work up to speeds of 30 MBps and the service is 50MBps. After easily installing the new modem the internet was instantly faster. Wonderful graphics and story,amazing shock horror! It's like a movie that you control. And best to play with the lights off and surround sound on. You forget its a game! I solely use this tablet for work. I only use it for work and not for personal entertainment use and this product deliver. It's very easy to use. Takes no time to learn your way around. Easy to install and provides great protection for my ipad. Does not interfere with the touch screen feature of the ipad. If you love South Park you will love this game. The game brings back old school turn based RPG gameplay. The cast of South Park characters is deep and the mature but immature humor takes a whole new level as restrictions imposed by television do not apply. Overall the game is a lot of fun with at least 12 solid hours of game play but due to some of the scenes in the game I would advise against letting kids play or even watch someone playing this game. For adults this is pure twisted entertainment. I have owned iPod classic and iPod nano. iPod touch is the new member in my apple family. The device is so compact and the sound is so crisp that no mp3 player can beat. Very easy to set up and looks great in my living room! :) I you liked the Free Willy movies this is the best deal to have all of them together. My last printer died just when I needed to print some tax forms. I've been having good luck with HP computers (the last three) that I thought I'd give an HP printer a try. My research said this model was a good one, so I took one home. Setup was quick, including the wireless part. It does an excellent job of printing. Can't speak to ink usage yet, but have high hopes. Bottom line: I like it and I'd buy it again. Easy to set up and easy to use. Great for keeping up on my email without being tied to my desktop PC. Now I have no unread emails. Great way to keep up with news. I use the apps to stay current on business developments and current affairs. Stainless steel microwave at great price. Great features with 1 button selection take the guess work out of determining the cooking time. Love it! Great sound quality and super easy to set up. I currently have two of these in surround mode but I got to tinker with them outside of the 5.1 system. By itself it's a great little unit when compared to other speakers like the big jambox by jaw bone it's in a league of its own!! Paired in stereo mode these are INCREDIBLE! Range is not an issue like it is with Bluetooth speakers and sound quality is better than just about any other wireless speaker I've ever heard. It's up there with the B&amp;W zeppelin A5. You can put two of these in stereo and add a sub for a superb music streaming system. This movie keeps the Ice Age movies going with a fun twist with dinosaurs. Overall I think it's a great product, I just bought it for my son's cell phone. The action in this movie seems very realistic keeping the movie very exciting. this is the classic Disney story. I warm, heart-touching story that is a lesson learned by a naive young woman.\n",
        "Lots of songs (Like the old classics). The star who voices Anna has a beautiful voice that will a tear to your eye during her songs.\n",
        "Love, tragedy, adventure, and most important - finding oneself.\n",
        "You really should see this if you are a Disney fan, or love family movies. This keyboard has a great feel and the back lighting is a plus It's always nice to have an extra battery to carry with you. It seems to have a long battery life. The sound is good, but setting up the speaker is not as easy as it would seem. Hooking up the speakers may seem simple, but its not. Overall the system sounds good, but the setup was not easy. I am a huge Martin Scorsese fan. Add this to the list of classic Scorsese films. I was able to connect my computer with the wire. I had issues with my computers trying to install them to network together, but I was able to use the wire and make a connection so that my computers could sync together. I was pleased with the result. Taken 2 is very similar to the first, just a slight change in the plot. I had high hopes for this TV after allot of research. Overall the picture quality is good, after you learn how to tweak the settings. I am a little disappointed with gaming (Xbox1), the lag isnt the best. Also I feel its a bit overpriced. Overall, not a bad TV. The Simpsons keep going and this is another great season! It works well, has good setting options and is flexible. This movie was right up there with the other Alien movies. Watched the movies years ago, me they are still wonderful. This was bought to replace our regular wii. We love that we can play as a family and have enough controllers. Server issues made it hard to play at first, but graphics are great and the game is fun my son loved the cute game card - I loved that it was on sale This is a good gaming mouse pad because it has a large maneuverable area. Like most fabric misleads, it collects slot of lint. This movie is fun for the whole family. Right up there with other Disney movies. These noise cancelling headphones work well for gaming with others, however, I have had occasional issues with my sound card temporarily crashing when I adjust the volume up or down. These sound really good on my Ibanez. Good response. Battleship sunk itself at the box office due to a weak story. However on Blu-ray this movie is simply stunning to watch. A near perfect picture. The audio is incredible. Battleship is a dumb movie but very entertaining at the same time. Lots of mindless fun to watch!!! I have only used this shaver 4 times since I purchased it. So far, very nice. It charges very quickly. The shaver is very quiet and very light weight, compared to my old Braun 8955. I have had 4 various Braun razors over the years. I was told by some other people that the Panasonic has a much faster speed to it's blades. It may take a while to my face to get used to the Panasonic, but my first reaction was that it did not cut as well as my old Braun. I had to go over a few areas a few more times and press a bit harder. We'll see what happens after a month or so. I can alway pass the Panasonic onto my son and go back to Braun series 7 if I feel the need. While I wasn't in love with the season overall (it was too far removed from the \"good ol' days\" of the client-of-the-week stories), the finale made up for it and was a great ending to the series. This \"Energizer\" manufactured AC/USB adapter is probably among one of the easiest products to review. Here is a common concept manufactured with the dependable quality of the \"Energizer\" brand name, which offers a simplistic product to suit a very practical purpose for various high-tech devices operating via a USB plug. From cell-phones, to jetpacks, to portable charges, etc.-if the unit requires to be fed electric power via an AC outlet in order to operate, and uses a standard USB plug connection, this product is the necessary conduit. Plug this into an AC outlet and insert the USB plug into its USB port and, whether your device is to be used directly in this manner or is in need of a battery charge to be used later in a portable manner, this compatibly adapts the AC outlet and USB connected cable. Most devices, of course, are accompanied by such an adapter, but should that one need replacement, an ordinarily highly durable part, due to damage or loss, or perhaps an extra or a spare may be desired, this simple product will do the practical, essential job. You usually needn't contact the original manufacturer of your device to purchase a compatible part, although if desired you could certainly do so; yet this product also can serve to convert your existing AC outlet into a USB power station or charger. There, candidly, are countless others available on the market of a similar or same general nature that are manufactured with just about equal standards, and, many, including \"Energizer\", are able to provide convenient management with dual USB ports or more. Nonetheless, if you need or want a product such as this, it is available to accomplish the job at a nice, low cost. I wish you could do more with categorizing of the diffrent music on this MP3 player such as seperate music of 70-80's,rock,oldies and so on and so on instead of having all the music all shuffled togeather. Sound is kind of cheep also.Would recommend a good pair of noise cancelling headphones. There are not many sequels that are better than the original. This one is. It is a great movie and good extras. With the some of the newest songs, the kids enjoy getting their groove on. Lots of laughs and great exercise! This hdmi cable does exactly what is was made to do. I have had no problems with it. It was a necessary purchase. My wife hates technology. I love technology. So we have to meet somewhere in the middle. I found this product in my search for a potentially expandable soundbar option. I wanted something with minimal wires that I could eventually make into a nice 5.1 system. I never thought I would find something like this little gem. Needless to say I'm hooked now! It isn't perfect and there are some snafus however overall I am in love with this soundbar. Sound wise it is definitely higher end - potentially audiophile quality or possibly right under. MUCH MUCH better than say a Bose product. This is the real deal 9 drivers, 3 tweeters and 6 mid woofers. It acts as a real 3.0 system. I originally went home with the playbar and woofer but within three weeks I had 2 play 3s on order to act as the surrounds. With this configuration I can confirm a discrete 5.1 channels with no faux surround in sight. Good stuff. The sub woofer is absolutely incredible. The cleanest sub I've ever heard, good spl also. The play bar and other speakers look fantastic, very high end indeed! The nicest thing about this system is it eliminates any need for separate music speakers or docks. Since every thing is wireless you can play music from your ipad without moving. It's amazing. I definitely listen to more music now that I have the sonos system. My biggest frustration is with the single optical input, however this is easily resolved with a $35 toslink switch. Good for the money. Good quality. This was bought for a senior citizen and she loves it. My son loves this game it is family friendly, and he loves to play the game. I was in desperate need of a replacement alarm clock that had two alarms and Bluetooth capability. I had bought at least 5 other clocks, but everyone of them was either a pain to use or didn't have the features I needed. I was a little leery at first about paying this much for an alarm clock, but I am more than pleased with it! The ability to change settings with little to no effort makes it the perfect clock. I'll be using this one for a long time! I love this dryer. I wish i could buy a second. The wonderful settings, and preloaded times are to die for. Its a dryer to have for a very long time. I'm glad i got the set it was a good movie but like all dvd movies over priced  An all time animated classic comes to life like never before! Three ways to watch, Blu-Ray, DVD, and Digital HD. Loaded with two hours of Bonus feature's and includes a great activity book for children. A great product for all age groups and family fun! Its an okay movie but like all dvd movies over priced I love this series, there are several different plot twists, the acting is good, most if not all of the characters are flawed making the line between good &amp; bad blurred. I always look forward to the next season. The kids and I loved it as we do all superhero movies Good TV with good price. Returned Samsung and got this. Way better than Samsung. The Breaking Bad fifth season is just as good as my favorite 4th season. I couldn't wait to see what happened and I loved the commentary by the actors. It's shocking/violent but could be appropriate for older children's viewing. Great casting and props Love using it while working out. I can either listen to music or watch videos online. Another great product from Sony. My grandson loves the gold. I love the old Married with Children episodes. I used to wake up early on weekends to have a laugh before I even got up for coffee. I bought the DVDs because they're funny enough to rewatch when nothing else is on TV or you just need a laugh I had a little bit of trouble installing. I called the service department of Sony and they were able to help me through it. Once I got them up and running, I have enjoyed using them. Good battery life and pretty good sound quality. Only some static sometimes. Hands down this is the best prepaid service for your money, Unlimited Minutes,Texts, and even DATA. The Data service is fairly fast until you run out of the 2.5gb of 4g LTE, then it is toggled down to 2g service. We wanted the My Cloud so we could store and play lossless audio wirelessly without turning on the computer. Not everything works as we would like, but we are able to play music. Hopefully, technology will be able to handle this some day. I think it is over a great value. graphics are very realistic and audo is great This is a great adult Series. This product is full of exclusive features that give more insight of the Series. This is a great product that works on many user platforms and more. This product is in Blu-Ray, DVD, and Digital Copy so it offers three ways to watch it. If you are new to Google TV, then buying this device will give you a few challenges on how it really works. I have a Logitec Revue on one TV and this device on another. The Sony runs circles around the Revue because of the Dual Core CPU and 1GB ram vs 550Mhz Atom CPU and 512MB or RAM.\n",
        "I highly recommend NOT hooking it up to a wireless device but hard wired into a switch that goes to a router or directly into one of the 4 router ports available. The experience will be MUCH better.\n",
        "Also update it over the wired connection before installing anything else.\n",
        "What it does:\n",
        "Charter customers - It intergrates nicely with their Cisco DVRs where you really do not need the Charter remote anymore with the exception of needing the Charter remote for DVR playback. The Sony picked up the DVR and now using Google PrimeTV app, integrates TV with movies available online - very nice.\n",
        "I use it also to stream movies from Plex. I recommend NOT using the integrated Sony Plex app but the REAL app from Plex\n",
        "Overlays its Google TV screen over the picture on TV to integrate TV and Internet in one. And if you power it off, the TV and STB will continue to function but you need the charter remote back. not a big problem.\n",
        "Because its Google, all my shows and favorites show up on both TV's as options since its all under one acccount.\n",
        "\n",
        "What it does not do:\n",
        "Will not control DVR functionality\n",
        "Cannot use latest versions of Chrome\n",
        "No Flash content for some sites that require latest versions of flash\n",
        "Uses JellyBean Android OS.. but not KitKat.\n",
        "Works excellent with Google Chomecast This system was easy to setup and use. Lots of features for the price. Calls are very clear with no distortion and it has a good microphone as callers can hear you very clearly and loudly. I had another Panasonic cordless system and if you wanted to clear the caller ID calls you would need to do that on each handset. This system syncs up with each handset and clears all the handsets at the same time when deleting caller ID numbers. It also has multiple ringer tone/type options. I like how the base unit is smaller than my previous Panasonic system, takes up less space on my counter.I expect to get many years of service from this new system. This movie is a must watch for any movie buff. a movie that will go down as one of the all time greats Great for my needs, use on a daily basis to browse internet, etc. This TV is absolutely amazing. The screen is huge and takes up less space than expected because the bezel is almost not existent which means it's pretty much all screen and no extra fluff. The picture is clear and with a little time it looks great. It is a little expensive. I got a really good deal on it and I couldn't pass it up. I haven't had a chance to try any 4k content but the PS4 and XB1 both upscale on it and look better than my previous 1080p tv so the Q+ really does make a difference. I wasn't quite sold on 4k and this sort of in between tv that will play the content made the decision to get a new tv of such a high price a little easier to swallow because its able to upscale to 4k if it does take off over the next few years. Speakers are ok especially considering the thinness of the tv. It's only a couple inches thick so there isn't much room for the speakers. Overall its a great tv with excellent picture quality and a giant screen that is capable to play the stuff in the near future. You can't go wrong if you can find it on sale like I did. I got this with my laptop purchase and thought it was easy to set up. We really like the product. Especially when kids\n",
        "Play on iPhone to TV thru apple tv. We enjoy the product If your looking for a new ps4 game that's\n",
        "Nor a sports game or for children this is it graphics are great mechanic's are smooth excellent buy The first laptop I got had problems with the touch screen. I thought it was just me - as I am new to windows 8 - but it really was a problem with the computer. I exchanged it for the same laptop and love it. So far, no problems with the touch screen. I love how i flips down and becomes a tablet - but the nice part is it covers the keys up, vs the other types of 2-in-1 laptops flip around to the back so the keys are left wide open. its a good kids movie a little expensive like all blue rays Well, what can one say about a cell phone case? This case does what it is meant to do. Protects from impact, rain/spills, and 2-year olds.\n",
        "\n",
        "The only complaint would be that it is too bulky to fit in a pocket most times. This means you will need those protective qualities because there is an increase in the probability that you will drop it/get it wet/taken by a 2-year old.\n",
        "\n",
        "Is it pricey? Yes, but you don't mind missing a meal or two, do you? This story is awesome , great animation, hope for more My 3 year old loves it -just like show! Def recommend Always enjoy the dc universe movies,great animation n story line This was a great addition to our work network, easy to install too This is a great game for my 6 year old to play. He loves it. Especially with the move controller. I was a new homeowner looking for a cheap yet reliable washer and dryer. This Amana exceeded my expectations. The HP-564 black ink replace cartridge, is provides excellent printing products. The fridge was delivered and installed by a team of professionals that took care not to bump or scratch anything g in the house as well as the new appliances. The team gave us directions for the first 24 hours, and left shortly after the work was done! The refrigerator was a little noisy the first night, but quieted down once it was cold. The filter took several gallons of water to put out clear water, but the water is crystal clear now. I've had the appliances for about a month now, and I love them.. I think I am a whirlpool fan for life!!! I would highly recommend this product to my family and friends!! where very happy to finally have the entire set together in one set to own and cherish The old Married with Children episodes are endearing as the family make fun of each other but in the end stay together and the parents tell each other they love each other. Typecast and similar to other shows about teens disrespecting their parents, their new and creative writing is predictable but funny This is the best gaming console I have ever owned. The major set back for me, is that I can't watch my 3D movies on it. I guess I will have to keep my PS3 until 3D is supported. I've never played FIFA before, but when I bought my PS4, it was the only sports game available. This game is a lot of fun, even if you're not a soccer fan. excellent case for the iPad was given to our oldest son, he loves it..... Great monitor that delivers a clear and crisp picture quality. The monitor brightness and overall contrast is fantastic, and gives a very vibrant and accurate picture. The slim bezels are fantastic too, so using it in a multiple monitor setup is very nice as there isn't much bezel space between the screens. Only real design flaw is the inability to adjust the height of the vertical stand, but the pros of this monitor hugley overwhelm any con it has. With DVI, HDMI, and VGA outputs as well, the monitor has a versatility for what you're able to plug into it. The monitor has no speakers, but as a gamer, I prefer actual seperate good quality speakers or a headset, so it's a non-issue. Great buy, and excellent monitor! This is a great amount of memory (and speed) at a decent price. It's a controller, what more is there to say? It feels great in your hands, the texture is comfortable, the buttons feel solid, the new placement of the triggers is excellent. Unfortunately the battery life is horrible, I'd say probably good for only 6 hours or so. Sony should have kept the PS3 battery in the controller. Best rap album for any real hip-hip fan, to listen too. Although the initial price is high, the colors last for a long time and do not run. The colors are clear and they don't run. Also, if printer is still in warranty, it is a must use to continue the warranty. Not much to say but, it is a very sturdy case and I haven't had any problems. This is a great cover. It feels good and seems very protective of the system. Its excellent if you plan to take your Yoga 2 Pro laptop outside of the house/office. It has also side holes that helps access the power and volume buttons.\n",
        "\n",
        "My only complain is that it doesn't cover the whole system. The fan section and the hinge is exposed, so the system is not 100% protected. It would have been excellent if it had some sort of flap to cover entire system.\n",
        "\n",
        "As son as there is something that covers the entire system and looks as good as this one, I may change it. This was a wonderful buy, honestly i wish i could buy another, the spacious tub makes it great for those large loads. i like the different cycles and settings and the preset times. It's a controller, what more is there to say? It feels great in your hands, the texture is comfortable, the buttons feel solid, the new placement of the triggers is excellent. Unfortunately the battery life is horrible, I'd say probably good for only 6 hours or so. Sony should have kept the PS3 battery in the controller. I am enjoying this tablet so very much! I would recommend very highly to anyone. A must see for Riddick fans, but not for everyone. This product serves it purpose. It has protected my Note 3 well. The color options weren't very good but I'm able to deal with. So easy to use, very cheap for the high build quality. Decided to buy the PS4 to get in on the new games, and hopefully have some upgraded hardware from the PS3. Unfortunately the system isn't finished. There's no blu-ray remote available yet, and Logitech Harmony remotes/adapters don't work yet. You can't stream from a computer or other network devices as there is no MP3 or DLNA support yet. Once all of the features are there that are supposed to be there, it'll be a killer system, until then, it's only slightly better than my PS3, mostly because it's not an awkward shaped unit. It'll be nice to be able to use it in my home theater when I don't have to use a game controller to use it. A must buy for metal gear fans, but not for everyone. I bought this to use in my usb slot on my car stereo because of its size. It has worked as advertised. It's not bulky and it is holding my catalog of over 2,000 songs. I recommend it to anyone looking for a small out of the way usb storage device. The set up was very easy, plug and play, my Comcast recognized modem with no issue. Up and running in about 5 minutes. The led indicators are VERY bright yet not marked very well. They are so bright you can't really tell what they are unless you keep the instructions open. Doesn't take long to figure out what they represent but I guess it's a matter of preference. Not a big deal but that is my ONLY issue with this modem. Definitely better than renting one from the provider that way over charges for a rental. It will pay for itself in no time. I bought this unit to up grade/ replace an older unit . I purchased one for my parents not long ago and decided the price was right for me as well, so I bought another one. This player is the best in its price range, and you cant find another that is capable of playing so many different formats. Samsung does it again. Great game! A must own for any fan of video games. This is a great product. Easy to install. Works great with my odd sized 3-gauge JL Audio flat cable used for grounding as well as my additional standard 4-gauge cables for powering my amp. I Use this to power my aftermarket stereo and upgraded ground cables. Cables connect tight and not wobbly at all. Covers are a nice touch too. See pic, sorry took this pic at night, little tough to see. The central heroine was a welcome change from the norm.\n",
        "I not only would watch this again. but already have.\n",
        "I have recommended this movie to my suspense and thriller friends Overall, Thor 2 is a great movie, darker than the other marvel comic superhero movies. Really like it. Fast and he can play multiplayer online games. Great for what the price is and maybe i just suck at keeping it safe but it didnt last long for me. This watch is way better than Samsung because you can use it on Android And IOS! And it does all the things Samsung smart watch does. works well dont have to refill ink as much. good for business applications If you're a fan of the movie, close your eyes and this music takes you there. If you're a fan of the movie, then you'll like the music. Loved the movie...I can't wait until the sequel and Avenger II Economical insurance policy to safeguard you from static electricity. Play it safe.. . This Drive is exactly whet i was looking for; easy set up.\n",

        "Thanks I needed a high capacity flash drive to transfer large jpeg files between PCs and did not want to use an external hard drive or server. this worked great and pretty fast. I was in need of a new HDMI cable after the one I bought from Amazon failed. This one worked perfectly for my needs. It was even gold-plated, which I did not anticipate. Overall, a great product at an unbeatable price. wanted a sound ba,r but this sounded much better for much less The reception turned out great once I got it on the right channel. And I could receive excellent reception from every room in my dwelling. The only down fall is that the headphones are too big. They keep sliding off if I lower my head because they don't adjust to fit smaller head sizes. this has a nice picture and sound. orginally purchased insignia and upgraded to sharp. I bought this to replace the old cable that I used to use for my internet connection. This works well and has a nice 8ft length instead of 6ft. I chose a 4 out of 5 stars because it is a game for the family to play. no blood or guts, just ballin baby. You get live stats for real NBA teams and keep up with your favorite NBA players. It is fun for young kids to old adults who like the competition in all of us... And of course bragging rites!!! I bought this to replace the garbage base model modem that Verizon sells you when you sign up for internet service. Wish I had gone to this years ago. Very dependable with no connectivity issues thus far. I bought this product cause it a great movie to see and add to my collection. The price for the blue ray movies was good at the moment This software works as advertised. I've been using Trend Micro for 6 yrs. and haven't had an infection, as of yet. What I have learned with the last two (2) installments is the ever dreaded \"not responding\" (Windows) when trying to get security summaries and such things. Runs smoothly in the background, updates are automatic, no need to go looking for them. Pricing value was 3 installs for $40, whats not to like about that. Great addition to the movie library. Very funny movie, definitely one you can watch more than once. I am always pleased to find this item in stock in your store! I like these earbuds but they aren't too comfortable in the ear after about an hour or so. Good value for number of batteries in package. Batteries have good life. Great kids movie and even adults that are kids at heart. free birds is a hilarious movie that would be enjoyed by both adult and children. My wife loves this artist and listens to them non-stop. Quoting my teenage son - \"Using HVID capture cord from PS3 to ElGato then USB from ElGato to Computer and HDMI from ElGato to TV. Recording video and sound lags a bit but no lag during play on the TV. If I miss recording something I can backtrack on the PS3 and still record it for posting online! HDCP fix/update from Sony for PS4 is coming soon. Can't wait!\" This is a must have product, easy to install, easy to store My wife purchased the mini 2 months ago and has not put it down since. She is not very electronically inclined so the iOS systems are more friendly for her. My grandson loves this game. He can't wait to be allowed to play. Very easy to set up and durable. No connection issues. This was a fun movie to watch. I loved the interactions between Thor and Loki. They were the best parts of the movie. Good next chapter of the Marvel Universe and plenty of room for the next chapter. I love it!! The story &amp; all of the characters are great!! Purchased for the WWE Network. My boys love that they can listen to downloaded music on the TV. YouTube function is great! Great game, multiplayer is addicting and it takes some time before it becomes repetitive but it's just a smoothly functioning high octane multiplayer classic. 6v6 multiplayer with various game types makes it hard to put down. Great collection for Chicago fans. Some of the best stuff that doesn't get enough air play. I wasn't sure about buying the screen protector because i never heard of the company. after my first one i was impressed. i have one on both my phones now. I have chosen this one with the maximum memory available for storing movies and books for my trip to Asia. It is handy and of good quality. It is a bit big if one is just looking for a communication device. But for good quality movies and easy-reading font size for reading, I do recommend it. Very fun to use. We print a lot and this was a good buy for us the ink and the printer. If we had to do it all over again we would buy the same thing again. The colors are bright and the ink cartridge has a long lasting quality to it. Great earbuds but I wish they had a longer cord. I need to use an extension now. Still sounds good.  To be honest, I bought a MacBook Air, simply to use this case. I get so many compliments. I don't buy a movie unless I know I will be able to watch it multiple times. The characters' emotional development provides the intensity in this sci-fy movie. Not surprising since that is the writing style of Stephanie Meyers. I did wait until the price came down on this movie before purchasing it, but it is still worth it! needed to mount my bose speakers and these mounts were perfect American Beauty won best picture when it came out. The movie was deserving of this award. This is an interesting sci-fy movie of the future. The acting was good, as well as the graphics. I like a big variety of movies and this one fits with my parameters, with a good, happy ending where good conquers the evil invaders! A great sequel to the Infamous series. The graphics are top notch, gameplay is fun as well so far. I love watching stand up. I have always thought Kevin Hart was a great comedian. This stand up did not disappoint. Great jokes and super funny! Works great, great quality with the images that are printed I love action movies, and this movie is filled with great action! It has a great story line, where evil is kept in check by the good guys. Thor reunites with Jane and the romance continues. Happy endings are critical for me. If a movie or book has a sad ending, I won't watch or read it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Along with all of the great action, romance and great ending is the fabulous graphics! At our house we rank movies from 1-10. This ranks a solid 9. Works great, lots of storage. Very fast recording. charges controllers greatly and for the price couldnt beat good family movie for family nite for the price. watch over and over Love this game. Kids will love playing it for hours. Good movie with a great cast. Could have been a little more action. A great film from director Martin Scorcese and perfectly acted by Leonardo Dicaprio, Jonah Hill, Matthew McConaughey and many others in the supporting roles. great movie was very funny and a great price as well overall i thought the movie was great and much better than Terminator 3 It was a great and funny movie for the price. Watch it over nd over This is the best computer I've ever owned. The price is incredible, it's easy to set up. As for the gaming power, if you know Garry's Mod, 40 fps! Great. Product works if you just want to use an inexpensive cable at a reasonable price! Total 80's camp. Witty one-liners abound, and the girls lockerroom shower fight scene, is only enhanced by the fact that you can see the shadow of the best grip production guy, and the mic comes down in the middle of the scene!!! Easy to use and affordable. Wanted it for Netflix. Easy to set up. Its a great color and very easy too use. Not a bad price movie was great but not as good as the first one. Still very funny but it just lacked the shock factor that the other two movies did. limited supply of my ink, was lucky to find the color I was looking for. Glad I picked up the ps4 over the xbox one. No regrets! Diablo 3's expansion, Reaper of Souls, does quite a lot to fix the issues that plagued the original Diablo 3. The Real Money Auction House is now gone, the new loot 2.0 system actually lets players get stronger with the loot they acquire (it's a smart loot system that more often drops loot tuned for your currently played class), there's a new craft (mystic) that lets players pay to reroll certain stats on loot, and that's just the beginning. The soundtrack is fantastic and really captures the overall Diablo tone and the new areas are quite expansive and not simple re-skins of current areas. Also, the level cap has been raised and new abilities and skills have been added along with an entirely new class (Crusader) so there's plenty to do. It's fresh, it's fun, it's fixed, it's addicting... it's Diablo. Thor: The Dark World is a more-than-worthy sequel to the original, boasting amazing visuals and heart-pumping action. Recommended to any fans of the Marvel universe films! Excellent movie. Great sound. Good story. Is a really good movie for a second part. I wish the movie had been longer, I still can't understand why he hasn't won an Oscar! Adventure Time is one of the most fun and thematically deep cartoons to come about in a long time. Bursting with color and originality, this show is highly recommended to viewers both young and old! I bought this for my girlfriend, she is a fan of apple and I'm not. However it works well. It does every thing its supposed to at a apple premium price but it does its job well and easily. It's a great game. If you enjoyed the 1st 2 games, you're going to love this 1. Downton Abbey is one of the best shows to come out of the UK in recent years, and the complete fourth season maintains a high level of quality! I was skeptical of PVZ because it was an online multilayer game only but this is has been a good experience each time. The developers did a great job combining the characters into the game play. Not only that but they promise free DLC through out the year. A must buy for any age group. Sandra Bullock gives one of the best performances of her career in this unique, visually-stunning thriller. My son and I watched every F&amp;F movie so far, and this one was right on par with the others (besides Tokyo Drift...yuk). This is a great, Academy Award-nominated film. DiCaprio once again gives an excellent performance that is more than worthy of his Oscar nomination. WD - My Passport Slim 1TB External USB 3.0/2.0 Portable Hard Drive is very easy to use, quite small and light weight (easy to travel with) and works great! It is perfect to back up your data, since it already comes with very easy to use software for that purpose. The graphics look better than the previous game and the story is just as awesome. The powers are a great addition to the game and makes Saints Row seem like a brand new game. Good serviceable phone that has multiple decent options verses other phone manufactures. Plus the weight is extremely comfortable for activities when held for long periods of time. I would recommend this for a small house. Quiet , energy saving n pretty. Easy to clean. The new iPad Air is as great as they say it is. Fast, thin and very portable. I use it more than my notebook. Family loves it. I love this game, its so much fun and worth every cent. Fits my head unit and vehicle perfectly. I recommend the purchase. If you want amazing range, this product is for you. Great sounding speakers. These were a little more expensive than what I originally wanted to spend, but no regrets. They seem to be a great purchase. We purchased this because our home is large and long. The WIFI receptionin our bedroom wing was spotty. This took care of that. we just plugged it in and everything loads like lightning now...no spotty reception. Easy Peasy and really inexpensive and portable. Great head unit with lots of features. I'd buy for my other vehicles when it's time to replace the stereo. awesome product for people who have problems with buds staying in. Good item for setting up my after market head unit. This is a good grill and recommend the purchase. The setup isn't as bad as I thought it would be. Only wish there were cabinets to enclose the bottom half of the grill. The cable seems to work just fine. There's not much else you can say about HDMI cable. I get a great picture. I use it between my television and the satellite box. This is the second Dynex Shredder that I have purchased. My last unit was broken by me as I was not paying attention to what I was shredding one afternoon....otherwise it would still be operating,\n",
        "\n",
        "This current unit is a simple powerful shredder that does what it says it will do, shred paper effectively. I also like the automatic shut off when no paper is inserted, it shuts off quickly, it does not run for an extended period, very beneficial considering the shredder is loud. One of the Bands , I find out about &amp; like them very well!! This is a great series, all the characters, plot twists, always keeps you interested and guessing. My other memory card reader would not read my video card. That new card reader work on my videos card for my video camera. Great case, only issues so far is the locking mech spring is misaligned. Still locks fine but makes a weird crunching noise. Worth noting, I found out the case is only slightly waterproof. Not that it claims to be and not that I would expect it to be, but my son got a hold of it and took it into his bath with him. The vita was a little wet, but still functions. Overall, the case did save the vita! Great case. Disney's newest film is my new favorite!! Great story line, fun, full of fun songs. I like the case. It works very well for me. The only complaint I have is that it will not allow me to use a credit card sliding device without taking the phone out of the case. If they could find a way to make that work better it would be perfect. This case has allowed us to feel secure about I-Pads or employees are using to take orders, process orders, and have the customer easily customize their orders. I-Pads are protected from spills, drops, and banging from our wait-staff as they process orders. It allows us to use a portable electronic device to increase customer satisfaction! Really good, but also very small so have to be careful. My first one got washed in my pocket, so you have to keep an eye on it. I use it mostly for working out and I like the clip and that it's light weight and doesn't interfere with my workouts. I like this phone because it works basically like the iPhone 4s that I had before it. Also, the phone held its value and over the course of two years when it came time to trade in it was worth almost what I paid for it. I hope that the new iPhone five does the same. I have a large head. They fit good, but with a larger head, it gets a little hot after 1/2 hour- 45 min. its a great product, easy to install, but the thing that got me was the price, why is zagg's products so expensive? but it looks good on my phone! Useful and helps with workout, but ear phones won't stay in my ear. A decent printer for the price. It was easy to setup and connect to my PC. The print quality is good. It was simple to get the hang of it. Unit is compact, easy to configure and reliable. You can't beat that for the price and performance. I would recommend. My mom got the bag for me as a Freshman and I'm still using now as a Senior about to graduate. The plastic on the handle cracked and is now in three pieces and there is some tearing on the straps. What do you expect from a well used back pack that's been thrown around though? Hot chocolate was spilled on it once but never seeped through to the inside. It has also been muddy several times from being placed on the floor of vehicles. There are enough pockets to organize my stuff and hide things. I am very proud of this product and my college backpack will be Swiss as well. This is a great accessory to have when away from computer or on the go to look at pictures or use as a remote (with live view) The Jacka** guys are at it yet again! I love all things Knoxville have been watching him since his \"big brother Mag/video' days! his bad grandpa character is one of my favorites! this movie will be sure to make you laugh and then laugh some more!..so sit back and enjoy! Maybe invite grandma over too! I am a big Mac user, but I wanted to be able to game. I wasn't sure about diving into an Alienware and I wanted the portability of a laptop. So far this product has been a dream and I can't wait to start it up everyday. I was extremely impressed at how quiet and cool it runs. Other than that it has handled my games flawlessly so far. It's a great idea to have a second battery in case the first one dies, it holds a charge off a long time and comes in handy this was a great add on for free to my ipad purchase, I installed it on there but it don't protect the item unless you use their browser, so because of the I keep getting email saying I have yet to install it This is a good price for batteries..\n",
        "They will last you a long time for all of your electronic needs! This is the best Cabela's game I've played in years. I stopped buying them two years ago, and then stumbled upon this one and thought I would give them one more try. The animal behavior is spot on and the maps are beautiful and huge. The bullet time is realistic and unforgiving at times. THIS IS WHAT A HUNTING GAME SHOULD BE LIKE. I originally purchased an HW-F450 to try with my Vizio M Series 50 inch Smart TV. I had it about a week, and while it worked very well, I decided to take it back to the retailer to exchange for the HW-H550. Glad I did as this is a huge upgrade to the F450. I have the sound bar connected to my TV via HDMI Arc and can report it works perfectly (the 450 did as well) . I have a universal Remote and the Sound Bar is completely controlled by the Vizio TV using the universal remote. It turns on when I power up the TV, volume and mute functions are controlled by the TV and appear on the LCD, and the Bar turns off when I power down the TV. The sound of the bar is very good. It replaces a BOSE Cinemate I had for quite a few years and it delivers as good or better audio than the BOSE. The bluetooth feature works well and pairs with my iPhone quickly. I am very pleased with the purchase and highly recommend the product. If you are looking for a nice, reasonably priced sound bar to improve the audio quality of your TV give this one serious consideration. I like the quality of ink for pictures. This item is not available in stores and must be ordered on-line for delivery or store-pick up. Very nice phone. LOVE the big screen! Only disappointment is that I thought it would take the best pictures and great videos but my husband HTC One beats it in both pictures and sound. As I said prints fast,easy to use menu,but unless the paper tray is FULL it says load paper,even if it's just printed out (1) sheet. from a full stack. It's annoying to keep adjusting the paper in the tray. Within minutes of setting up and putting a fully charged battery in I was taking pictures that had amazing quality, the FPS is quick, the auto-focus is great and the quality of everything is as expected (amazing great quality) this movie was a fun trip in horror comedy! its a move to experience for sure!\u2026it will make you laugh, cry and laugh some more! Milo is the modern gremlin! haha i always wanted one of these and I was pleased to get this on sale. This is a great game! Excellent graphics and cool story line! Recommended to all who love action games! the ps3 is an amazing console and the last of us is the best game of 2013, if you haven't played it or want a console but can't afford a ps4/xbox one, i highly recommend this bundle It works perfect! It gave me fast internet service for my computer and phone hook up. I am a huge fan of Samsung products...from phones, tablets, tvs etc. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a quality television. good shelf for the money and matches an existing shelf i had purchased almost twelve years ago for movies I would highly recommend the IPHONE 5S as it does what it says it will do. And with Best Buys' price and helpful staff... it was a win win situation! Great batteries for the myriad of toys my grandchildren have. i got 2 of these for my son he thought that they were stylish I really like this product. It keeps the coffee or tea pretty warm. This adapter fits well and is deceptively small (I know the pic makes it look kind of large). I actually lost it for a few hours the day I got it, but have since found that putting a little velcro on it keeps it where I expect to find it in the office. As for functionality, it works like a dream: just plug and play for almost all devices. I am torn about referring this to a friend because it's a bit expensive and the likelihood of losing it is pretty high given its diminutive nature...maybe if it comes down in price it would be a better option. I am so happy with this product. Easy to use and connect. I don't have to worry about any scratches, it's a great protector. The purple color is also beautiful. Takes great pictures! A lot to learn when it comes to the settings.\n",
        "I suggest getting the DVD or youtube the videos. I bought the album, because I wanted the artist's newest album. Great product! Totally worth the money. Tons of storage and so simple to use. It is a great apple product. I have a LG smart 55\" TV and adding the Apple TV device made it Smartest Idiot Box. So easy to setup and install. I love the way i am able to control the device through my iPhone 4s. Watching my iPhone pictures, videos on Big screen is so cool. The device processor is very fast. The fast forward and rewind feature is very slick it is based on the speed of your finger swipe i love it. Airplay feature is a amazing just play on your any apple devices and watch on your TV. Controlling the apple TV device from any of your iPhone, iPad, laptop is great. This lens is really a great addition to our new camera. The associate who we bought camera from initially warned us that if we didn't purchase the additional lens we would be back soon to get it simply because the initial lens is good for relativey close pictures but the additional lens would make so much of a difference -HE WAS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!!! It is not bulky, has a smart cover feature, sleek design and was exactly what I wanted in my cover.  This product is what I was looking for it does everything I was looking for and would change it for nothing in the world This product has given me full security for my laptop needs. I really enjoyed this movie! Special effects were amazing. Being able to hop from one space object to the next was a little out there. Bottom one is this is a really fun movie to watch Here is a Disney classic that is such a great movie. What more can I say... Everyone should see it. Catchy songs, great story &amp; it makes us feel like a kid again. Even tough I have to fill the tank every day, it serves its purpose, to humidify a small bedroom. Great product for anyone wanting to use a mouse as well as a touchpad. My wife told me to buy this for our new Nikon 3200. She knows more about this stuff than I do...but she is happy with the product, so that means I am as well. Solved a issue that the new X1 carbon has...no nic.\n",

        "We are using these to allow initial installation of various drivers and adding to domain. Deployed to end users for home use or when on the go and a hardwire is more desired than wifi. We were so pleased when we got it home we vacuumed the whole house. Got more dirt than we thought we would...\n",
        "We were not able to get replacement bags for our old vacuum, so needed a new one with HEPA filter and no dust recirculation. I really enjoy vacuum with this Dyson. It gets all the dirt that is on the floor. Office 2013 is a must have for anyone preparing documents and spreadsheets. positives kick stand works nice and has a strap to hold cover shut. Negatives edges of tablet are exposed and if dropped in rocks or concrete could damage tablet. love the speed, for the cost this was the only 3.0 in stock. Very small easy lost but so fast. The sonos speaker is very easy to set up and Gives you the freedom to play your music wherever you have an electrical outlet. Long over are the days of wiring your house for sound. It is a little pricey, but the system is well worth it in my opinion. Big Madden fan. Game gets better every year. Kicks on PS4. Keep up the good work EA!!!!!!!! This device is easy to use, great for traveling, but it has the capacity of a large computer.. Apps are easy to download and there is a very good variety. Good movie. Falls in line with the rest of the series. Exactly what I needed. The price was within my budget and the laptop functionality is excellent for all my home and office related tasks. The only thing that would make this game more similar to call of duty would be if it was first person. Highly recommend this movie. Great story and action. Dryer is so easy to use. I got it for a very good price The refrigerator, the delivery, and the installation all were as promised and on time. Plain and simple - the price is good also. Black is the color I wanted as well. Found all good with this product and use it regularly with good results everytime. Amazing series, would definitely recommend. I read all 5 books and watched the previous 2 seasons and am completely hooked. This is a very good product that works as advertised. I think that the manufacturer does a great job of 'skirting' around the issue with regards to uploading your data. I didn't read between the lines when I made the purchase. So, I needed to buy another piece of equipment to upload my data. The phone is great overall. The speed and graphics are the best that I have had in any of my phones. LMAO. Funny. i love anything Cristopher Walken is in but still a great film This is a nice keyboard for the price. Not any bells and whistles - but you don't always need all of that. Good action, good plot. It is all you might want and all it suggests it is. It's a nice keyboard and I was able to use it right away without needing any updates or needing to install any software. I have had it for over a month now and I love it. Best solid keyboard I could find without feeling as if I was paying too much or that it was cheaply made. I was able to get this for under $200, so for the money this was a steal. I have been very happy with the picture quality and the sound. I wouldn't use this as my main living room TV but it's great for the bedroom. My only real complaint is that there is a significant lag in time switching from one input to the other. I liked htis movie a lot. DOnt watch it whil etired as you need to pay attention to all the players. PLenty of gratuitious violence so that is always good for a foregin film. Loved it. It is small to carry around and takes good pictures another painful accessory needed for the x1 carbon with no display adapter, allows projectors to be used without issue. good protection for th ipod, also easty to put on and kids love it. Apple products a quality items and I have always had good luck with them. I would recommend them to anyone. Easy to setup and easy to use!! It was a gift and he loved it!!! This little guy can perform at high speeds and is very portable. Id recommend this to anyone in college. Great set of headphones. Good sound quality and don't fall off. Perfect for running! Most of the movie is ok, I bought it because it was on sale and I'm a sucker for movies like this I LIKE THAT ITS A TOTALLY SEPERATE STORY FROM DESMOND I was hesitant about spending that much money for a case however having 2 young boys I was willing to give it a try. I have been very happy about the case. I've already dropped it and had stuff spilled on it but no problems yet! The print quality of documents and pictures is excellent. The e-print feature is very easy to use. It prints fairly quickly Wow, this is an amazing picture and is future proof for 4K content. The upscaler is so effective that my brain is in overload from all the detail. Had to go to movie mode while I get used to the visual overload. I sit 12 feet away for this big 70\" television and there is a clear upgrade from my Sony 1080P 60\" Wife says it's like looking at a video that we took from our camcorder. Colors could be better, but it's new and I have some tweaking to do. I highly recommend this model over the more expensive (higher contrast ratio) model with the 4 leg stand ($400 more !) This is the one to get. It will make your head hurt tyring to figure out if it's real or not. This Microsoft Mouse is great. Bought it to use with my surface. Works well Nice printer that does it all well. Nice to have a document feeder for more than one copy at a time. I loved the storyline. I also loved seeing sooo many familiar faces. I bought this to use with my 60in Aquos Sharp Smart TV and it worked like a charm, just like that, no problem. I was so surprise and ecstatic as I did not have to return because it worked really great right out of the box once you attached the usb to the TV I like the versatility of the smart phone's features for multitasking. Logitech - M325 Wireless Laser Mouse is a convenient size. It is easy to use and carry or store. It has a good response, and it controls the pointer quite a distance from the laptop. I Love the way i can use this device with multiple devices. Overall a must have for any true Game of Thrones fan. I wish each episode had commentary and that there were more extra scenes but they give so much more that it makes up for it. Great listen, particularly tracks 10-12. Good travelling CD. I really enjoyed Thor: The Dark World. I have never been a huge fan of the character in comics but the first movie changed that. I thought the second outdid the first. Saves money because we don't dump out pots of unused coffee. Also great for making a cup of hot water and tea. good protection for the ipod 5, my granddaughter loves the monkey. Overall 9/10\n",
        "Blizzard has really stepped it up with the RoS expansion as they overhauled the loot system, fixed many outstanding bugs that the community has been waiting for and greatly improved the environments to carry on some of the aspects that made D1 &amp; D2 great while pushing D3 to the next level and truly making it stand out as the latest/greatest addition in the Diablo legacy. Great game! Overall. I am very pleased. And love to have tablet capabilities, while being able to use Microsoft office products. could not access my hard drive from my computer anymore, this enclosure worked just as described for sata hard drive Opted to install this screen protector myself. It was easily installed and looks great. Simple protection and fully functional My 2009 Chrysler Town and Country was missing the headphones when I bought it, so I search for quick cheap replacements for the kids, these worked great. I found the game to be very entertaining. I like the story and different abilities that are attainable. Monty Python movies are all great and should be seen by everyone. This movie is superb. This product is easy to set up and use and great value for all it does. Quality of picture is good. A little fragile so you have to be careful of installation. But it is pretty good. Perfect size for us in our auto body shop. lightweight and fast. I'm enjoying my speaker box and what I love about it is that it gives the music the right sound that comes out of it. I didn't know I would like this much This is an epic movie that is everyone should see before they die. Kids love this movie. Love to sing along with Elsa and Anna during movie. Perfect for older people. Simple to use and good layout of channels. In the past I have had many dryers that would not dry clothes unless i did them a second time in the dryer. This dryer allows me to set up settngs for the different types of clothing and at the same time ensure they come out wrinkle free This is a good movie for adults. Leo does an excellent job, as well as the rest of the cast. These batteries are great. They are extremely reliable and last a long time. THE USB PLUG IN FOR THE WIRELESS MOUSE IS SMALL AND DOESN'T PROTRUDE OUT FROM THE COMPUTER VERY FAR. THE ERGONOMIC FORM OF THE MOUSE IS COMFORTABLE TO USE AND SCROLLS THROUGH ITEMS VERY QUICKLY. I AM ON A COMPUTER FOR MY BUSINESS FOR OVER 10 HOURS PER DAY AND THIS WORKS PERFECTLY. I don't play it, but my son and daughter love playing this game, they build tracks, homes, it really helps with imagination and play. From start to finish this movie is filled with laughs. It really doesn't hurt to have Anna Kendrick for my eyes to feast on. Well acted and excellent story. I was thoroughly entertained. I enjoyed the movie and will watch it again. The acting was great, probably why Jared Leto won best supporting actor and Matthew\n",
        "McConaughey for best actor. This armband is a great product and is great for running. The only downfall to it is that it builds up condensation on the inside while working out. Went from a tiny microwave to this one. Was afraid it would dominate my counter top but it doesn't. Power is great. Operates easily and is sleek and stylish. I'd definitely recommend it! I have only had the case a short time and have not dropped it so I have no idea to the quality of the case on protecting my phone. I love the bright color and it is so light weight. The case is not much bigger than my phone so it nice and compact. Fits easily into my pocket.\n",
        "\n",
        "The power button on top is hard to push on and off that I have to use two fingers to push it, wish it was easier. We are very pleased with this tv, especially for the price. We bought it for our RV and it fits in the allowed space very nicely, plus it is much lighter than our previous tv. My primary use of this product is to measure my pulse while exercising on a treadmill. After purchasing and utilizing a transfer jell the readings appeared to be more accurate and much faster then when I was using water to moisten he area where the sensors were placed on my chest. You will get stuck playing it for days. Great game to play during a raining day! It works fine-it does what it is supposed to do.\n",

        "This flash drive works fine- it does the job. Been a fan since i was a kid every movie keeps getting better and better and waiting for the next one to be made. PRODUCT WAS VERY EASY TO INSTALL AND ENABLED THE COMPUTER TOWER TO BE SET UP FOR WIFI. I'm satisfied with this purchase. This is a good looking TV stand that can hold up to a 50\" Flat Panel LCD/LED/Plasma TV. We all know that when Tom Hanks is on the set the movie is dope. I really like the fact that they casted regular people to play the pirates. Another great solution for those X1 Carbons that do not have on board vga for projector use. One of these and the end user is happy since they can use any projector within the company. Good movie with good effects and acting. Nice story line This toaster did the job what i was thinking for, we love it! This is good change to buy Nintendo game.\n",
        "You can buy Nintendo game for low price. The movie had a good script with some of the best black actors in the game right now. I bought this laptop knowing I'd dislike Chrome OS. I gave it an honest try and it is too constrictive. I don't like being trapped in by Google.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fortunately, this is a great little machine for Ubuntu. Obviously, not everything is supported natively. There is however, a very active Ubuntu-C720 userbase that worked out the kinks and got everything fuctioning very well.\n",
        "\n",
        "I reccomened this machine if you like to experiment with Linux distros. I tried a few, and Ubuntu 13.10 seems to work best. The SSD is short on space but it is upgradable. Over all season was great and its a great show so far and leaves you wanting more with all the suspense I really enjoyed this movie, but I have heard mixed reviews about it. There is not as much action in it as you might expect. I felt there was a fair share of Wolverine slicing people apart, but others have wanted more slicing and less story-telling. I thought it was a really enjoyable story, and it introduces some interesting ideas for the X-men universe moving forward. Caddyshack has to be the definition of comedy. It's pure genius in the form of laughter.\n",
        "\n",
        "The reason why it's genius is because you take some of the funniest comedians/actors of our time and somehow manage to add them to golf. Believe me. There's nothing funny about golf, but Caddyshack provides laughs for many years to come. I didn't buy this bag for a camera - I needed something to carry extra wires for my laptop and the size and shape of this bag was perfect. Seems pretty rugged and easily packed in other luggage or a backpack. For a true Hip Hop lover this is not only a fun game to play. Also gives old and new songs that you might not heard in a while!!  The movie is one that is definitely rare. Rare with it having Stallone and Arnold in it. I purchased for cleaning my large flat screen TV screen, It seems to do a fine job. This was offered for free for six months with our purchase and we could upgrade for a full year for a small cost. It is worth it to protect the computer against viruses. Bought this device 3 months back and use it a lot. Easy to pull up not just youtube but also other browsers with this device to quickly pull it on the T.V. Only issue I have is that for some website's it starts to slow or halt when the same will run smooth on a laptop. All in all, great device. I have always been a fan of Thor and Marvel has done a great job of bringing him to life. these controllers are far superior to xbox one controllers Gave as a gift and it was appreciated for its utility and good looks. the kids have watched it over and over i myself have also seen it a few extra times The office program provides needed applications for my son to complete his homework assignments. Works great with touchscreen computer! I am really enjoying Titianfall!!! I am having a hard time keeping my kids off of it so I can play. Easy to set up and good quality picture for home use. Dark Elves some crazy peeps, yo, this movie was great action. To be able to check out the titanic experience in 3D is very cool. Visuals are great. Easily cloned from old hard drive. Amazing how fast it booted up and how quietly and smoothly it runs. Loads programs and files much faster than mechanical hard drives. Doesn't have a ton of storage but I basically only need it for operating system, etc. anyway. I use an external hard drive for most storage. . This Toshiba flash drive is just the right size for all the things my son needs to store. It is a great price, good quality, easy to use, and overall a great deal! My grandson loves this game. He said it was his \"best gift ever\" and he plays it almost every day. It's Thor. You can't go wrong with the god of thunder. Loved the whole marvel series thus far. The modern day era of Sherlock Holmes could not be protrayed any better than this. I love Band of Brothers. It's the first HBO series I purchased, and this is actually the second time I've bought it. It was well worth the second purchase because it's the Blu-ray tin. my daughter looooves this movie so much . she wants to watch it all the time. Great movie for any fan of the series and those are not. It's easy put in my pc and connect for charge my battery range. This is a wonderful computer bag for my son to put his Toshiba laptop in. The material and strap are very durable and the bag looks nice. It is very easy to clean and the padded part for the shoulder strap is a nice addition. It also has handles that he can carry it by if he doesn't want to use the strap. It holds his laptop, charger, mouse, mousepad, and memory stick with no problems. This is a great bag for a laptop! The 3D version is way cool. - way better than the non 3D version This is the forth set of headphones purchased in the last 2 years, hoping these last longer than the other ones purchased. Pretty easy to use and assemble for use on the i phones Bought this recorder for insuring troublesome conversations could be recorded and transcripts made should the need arise. Outstanding value and ability to archive all recordings to my computer or burn then to CD/DVDs. Works great, you cannot go wrong with an apple product My first device with a camera - it's great to see a large image for composing the shot before clicking. The new look elegant of PNY Monkey talil design is perfect, because it is save in my pocket or in my work place. It's marvelouse have this product. Thanks... Loved the game series. Would recommend it to any hardcore gamer. This system is very easy to set up and use. Taste is amazing, but all in all, a 2 liter bottle of Coke or Pepsi at your local supermarket will usually cost less I've played through the last two games and didn't see much difference in this new next gen one other than the graphics. But don't get me wrong. I loved the other two and this one is great too. The open world setting is broken down into districts which you have to clear of bad guys and progress through the story. There aren't as many side missions as in previous games but adds tasks like searching for hidden cameras, doing graffiti, saving prisoners, finding the disguised baddie, and a few more. These get repetitive quickly but need to be done to get 100% completion. Overall the game is addicting to play as you will want to do everything and power up to the max. Easy to place in the laptop, and is compatible with my Windows 7. Good experience IN ALL NOTHING BAD ABOUT MY PURCHASE I HAVE BEEN PLAYING WITH IT SINCE I BOUGHT IT. CAN REALLY HEAR ME GETTING BETTER IT IS GOOD FOR ME BECAUSE I AM A BEGINNER AND WITH NO WORRIES I WILL NOT BREAK IT. GREAT SOUND AND QUALITY THE ONLY THING I HATE IS THAT IT TENDS TO GET OUT OF TUNE AFTER A WHILE BUT ALL IN ALL A GOOD. Good movie and awesome FX. Kept me glued to the tv the whole time. The ending was disappointing, it seems a sequel will fallow . This product is great to protect what you spent a lot of money on.. Excellent choice for save information in any platform. I'm so happy with this product. The product does so much more than I will ever use it for. Happy with purchase, with the exception of above mentioned problem. .A classic TV show that everyone should see at least once Whirlpool went out after 9 years. Had upgraded all other appliances to GE and did my home work I thought. Great price match enough to even get a new GE built in Microwave. Upon first use I was not happy with this purchase. Condensation and a lot of moisture on dishes. I immediately called the store. I mean the dishwasher was not cheap by no means and I thought in the back of my head what a mistake I made. The return was set up. I researched until my head was spinning with dishwashers. Seems most do not even have a dry mode. The water temperature is supposed to dry the dishes. So I went to GE website and researched and also read the owners manual. I checked the water temp and it was at 125 degrees. On page 13 in the owners manual I struck gold as I was going to give it one more try before I returned. I used the WASH TEMP BOOST option with NORMAL CYCLE and HEATED DRY option. The dishes were totally dry and no condensation at all in the tub! Saved me time and money. The cycle does take longer than my old dishwasher but this is with most ALL new dishwashers. It only uses 3 gallon's of water. Ultra quiet as well. .A classic TV show that everyone should see at least once The third season of this wonderful action/fantasy/adventure series does not disappoint. The acting, the action, and the OMG moments are all there and better than before. If you haven't seen the series before, you have to start from the beginning, trying to catch up from this point is very tough. Also, not recommended for watching while children are around, or those faint-hearted about language, violence, or nudity. This shredder does exactly what I need it for and is a great price! the controller is bad. I have to press hard on the keys and hold them for longer to get it to respond, and I experienced freezing of the volume, channel selector and the on/off buttons. So I have to unplug the power and press on again to make it work. .A classic TV show that everyone should see at least once I use these as a backup if HDMI is not available. Very dependable No complaints. Works as it was intended. Pretty simple. AWESOME PRODUCT. MY SON REALLY LOVES IT. IT COMES IN HANDY... This is my first otter box and it was obnoxious to put on the phone. Once I finally got in on, it fit nicely and it looks cute. As for durability and protection, I've only had it for about a month so I haven't had time to really put it through vigorous testing Love this movie I love this type of movies. Wish there were more made This is great cable. I use it occasionally when I need to as I travel. Never had a problem If you watched their previous movie Resident Evil Degeneration the 3d graphics were a little on the poor side. The acting was bad and the voice synching was a little off. With Resident Evil Damnation they stepped up the game with both graphics and acting. The story line was easier to get into, the action shots are pretty impressive for a 3d animated feature. In the suspense/ horror side I found myself at the edge of my seat, pretty intense. If you have played any of the resident evil games this feels true to the game. I was pretty happy with this purchase. I also am a huge resident evil fan and felt this is truer to Capcom's view of their series. Works Like it was intended. No problems. Stays connected 24/7 This cable stays connected 24/7 to a projector that is in constant use. No problems with image quality whatsoever I love comic book movies and this one did not disappoint. I enjoyed the plot and the acting as well as the cinematography. Overall a great game for a child. Sometimes needs a little help with the navigating. My son loves the game. It has kept him entertained for multiple weeks. He loves the ability to trade Pok\u00e9mon characters with other gamers. I know this game and all Pok\u00e9mon DS games are his favorite. Definitely a huge improvement from the 4s. This one is much faster, the camera is amazing and I love the fingerprint id thing. It makes downloading music and apps so much easier. Even with my upgrade discount, it was still pretty pricey and I'm not completely sure if it was worth the cost but so far, I'm not disappointed I lost my Apple tv remote, so I made this purchase to replace it. Works like a Charm. The only complaint is that it also appears to work with all of my other Apple Devices as well. So every now and then when using Apple TV the iTunes on my laptop will begin to play without warning Works just like it should. Was easy to use and set up. Purchased this product to replace old ps3 and it is amazing. Updated graphics make it well worth the upgrade. I not real familure with it yet but I guess ill figure it out This was a great movie all the way to the end. The ending was great! Highly recommended for all Thor fans and Avengers fans alike. IT IS GOOD FOR MY KIDS ,ESAY TO USE,NO COMPLICATE. I previously had the 32gb Version (for about 24 hours) before I realized it was too small to hold all of my media files. I also like all the Dif Color choices. What a great movie. The 3D is great to watch and well done Great to buy this with a discount when it is hard to find in the stores. I think if you buy a computer set up and phone they could give it to you free I enjoy all the iron man movies, this one is just another to add to my collection. Great Phone. I am so glad that I was delivered from the whole android circle. The folks who use androids like I used to are always saying they prefer it over the Iphone because it is \"open source\" I then ask them Really? Are you a programmer? (answer is always no) THEY WHY DO YOU CARE? The Iphone is intuitive. Things that just seem like they would make sense to be able to do were programmed into the phone. Ex. When ever I make a typing error all I do is shake the phone and BOOM the undo edit or cancel option comes up. THANK YOU APPLE! The Camera is Amazing! The Talk to Text is almost flawless (I speak 3 languages) This is a fabulous movie, really great entertainment. I would recommend this move to watch. What can you say about the movie, It is really good and funnier then you would think. The action was very good (it is marvel) and the 3D is worth the extra money. The story is so much fun to play out &amp; every time you think you are getting to the end a new twist happens that makes the story more crazy. However, the content makes the movie look PG, it really should be 21 &amp; older to buy &amp; play. Was a great movie to watch with the family. The setting was deffinitely out there and acting was good. The plot had a couple of stretches to the imagination and the ending needed a bit more to satisfy the watcher. This one lived up to all the build up. Great performances all around. I love all of the Marvel movies. The story is extensive and the characters are great. The Otterbox Defender Series is great if you want to get the most protection for your device. Not so great if you plan to keep it in your pocket. If you're going to be throwing the phone in a purse or carrying it on your hip I would definitely recommend it. If you're going to be putting it in your pocket where you will pull it in and out frequently, you may look for a case with a sleeker design. Spectacular sound, it is expensive, but after too much though I don't regret the purchase. interesting story line. I like all the Avengers characters and enjoy the movies when they each head out on an adventure on their own. Great visual effects, Action packed. There are a few Comcast-approved cable modems, and this is one of them. It has a fast connection speed, and covers a large area for Wifi connections. For the case of our home, we have about 10 devices for wifi connections; and this cable modem appears to work fine. You know what this is if you have a Wii or a Wii U. It's absolutely essential to own at least one (two preferred)! Most Wii games &amp; many Wii U games utilize this controller or give you an option to use it.\n",
        "The C/Z buttons take some getting used to, but if you like the Wii remote using this comes easy. It's light and fits in the hand nicely.\n",
        "If you are coming from a standard controller, this can seem awkward &amp; tricky though.\n",
        "Multiple colors are a nice touch to either mix/match with your Wii remote or to personalize.\n",
        "Also, the same Nunchuck can be used with the Wii or Wii U with no extra set-up.\n",
        "Note: Wii remote required. Unbelievable thrill ride. This movie makes you feel like you're in space with Bullock and Clooney. The special effects are top notch and the story helps you feel connected to the characters. Bought this to try with my pi - some cards don't work, but this one does. I thought this was an amazing film - full of energy and great performances. Specifically Leonardo DiCaprio. He is always a really amazing actor, but here he displays something I don't often see from him - humor. He is hysterical. The whole movie is really funny and moved at a great pace - I didn't feel the 3-hour length at all. Also, Jonah Hill - I think this is his best performance. He's fantastic too. If you like Scorcese, you won't be disappointed. This has the same kind of drama and humor you'd expect from him, but he's really at the top of his game with this film. I will be buying this as soon as it's available. Price is great compared to cost of lower models same brand. The sound level doesn't have to be cranked up to have a clear and understandable reception. Love the fact that I can be standing beside the person wearing the headset and not hear what he/she hears. Great for watching things on the big screen. Portable, bring it anywhere for travel. Just make sure you sync your device with the apple remote app. so that you won't need the remote. I really underestimated this movie. I was not inclined to rent it, but I'm glad I did. The acting was superb; Hanks definitely gave an Oscar worthy performance, and the pirate captain was very convincing in his mixed emotions as things didn't go as planned. The script was riveting, leaving me at the edge of my seat the entire time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Apparently, some of those who gave the movie only one star due to their perception of a ridiculous premise -- an unarmed crew with the captain shooting flares at the pirates -- don't realize the movie was based on actual events, that this was how the captain tried to defend his ship.\n",
        "\n",
        "I also liked the fact that the piracy of an impoverished nation stemmed largely from the fact that fishing conglomerates had wiped out the fishing industry of Somalia, an important reminder of the damage our industries often impose on the economies\n",
        "of other countries.\n",
        "\n",
        "Would I recommend this movie? Absolutely, a truly worthy movie in terms of thought provoking as well as edge-of-your seat excitement in my opinion. The first Thor was my favorite. This one does a good job for a sequel! Special effects are awesome and the story line is good. Only about 5 people in the whole movie. Kept us on the edge of our seats all the time. Fairly short movie. Good acting. Great Visual Effects and photography. so far I have no complaints and like it very much I like that it is light. I really enjoy using this computer. It's worth it for the price. I want to use it all the time. I purchased this product a couple of months ago and just love it! It is really a quality product and would recommed to all my friends. This game is fun. I find it very challenging where I'm doing the level over and over again trying to score a perfect. I like playing this game at night time because its takes you into the game and your easily startle with certain event in the game... Check it out you see what I mean. I love my fitbit. It allows me to track my sleep habits and steps taken in a day. I always felt like I've walked many miles at the end of a day but with the fitbit I realized it wasn't as many steps as I thought. It motivates me to walk around more and to take stairs. I love that I can set goals for myself and track my food intake. The fact that it connects wirelessly and updays to an app on my phone is a bonus. I have also purchased some accessories and can now color cordinate my armbands. Its easy to use which is a plus as I am not that \"techie\" Called cable company and was online within 5 minutes. Definitely much better than paying $7/month for a rental. Been using for 2 months and haven't had any problems so far. Internet is noticably faster than the rental modem I was using. Works great, so far. is pretty and matches my case This headset has amazing sound quality and works with Microsoft Xbox One headset adapter. The EQ button is very useful, it provides 4 EQ presets that let you customize the sound depending on what you are using the headset for, be it gaming or movies. I've run into one issue with a firmware update for the MixAmp (Update 5003), people that I game with say that since the update my voice has been muffled when coming through chat. Hopefully this issue is fixed soon by Astro, otherwise I will have to revert back to an older firmware version. I've been pleasantly surprised by the battery life of GoPro's batteries. Finally something that lasts as long as expected.  Have 1st two seasons and anxious to watch the 3rd and future seasons. Great shows. Not recommended for young kids. This item is great for anyone with a Wii U or 3DS. If you plan on downloading anything on the Nintendo eShop, this is a better alternative to giving credit card info online. You purchase them on a $1 for $1 basis, but these go on sale once in a while and the it costs even less to purchase.\n",
        "Also great if you don't have a credit card. I use this for aerial applications and very pleased with the lightweight new standard. The pictures and video are incredible. I would really like to take advantage of the wireless remote feature, but the wifi range is well below what is advertised, even in ideal conditions in the middle of nowhere. An excellent product. Room for all my files and bills and protects the laptop nicely. Also even fully loaded room for a tablet and room for accessories and maintains a compact outer dimension. Would recomend for anyone needing to commute with a laptop or tablet. Great controller at a great price on the web special I use this to puree my infant sons food..and this does the job very well. Saves my money on baby food..... Im very happy with my magellan gps ,it works great and is very easy to use. For the first time i didnt get lost on my trip to Boston! Overall, I'm very impressed with the whole built quality, and screen resolution. When you first get it, you will not want to get your hands off of it! Trust me. I transitioned from a non-Retina screen, and you can totally see the difference. I love the new OS Mavericks - it is very simplistic!\n",
        "\n",
        "I also enjoy the 16GB of RAM, and the 2GB for the Graphics Card (Video). It brings everything you watch on your MacBook Pro really smooth.\n",

        "I really enjoy the battery life. It gives you so much more access to it, while not thinking about charging it very often throughout the day.\n",
        "\n",
        "I must critique on this...the sounds (to me) is it not as \"high\" quality as you would want it to be. I don't know if it its because I'm used to listening through my Bose speakers, but I will give props to the sound for what it is worth. I've had this LG G2 about 6 weeks now and am still learning the features of the phone and the Android system. I really like the screen size and the sharpness of images. I find it pretty user-friendly. My sister got one first and after her raves, I am very happy I got one too! This is a great product for the price its awesome not having very many wires at all. The only knock on it is that though it works great with my tv, my tv is also old so I actually have to turn it on every time and it only works for my tv not my playstation, dvd, etc. If I want it to work with those I have to wire it to the machine itself. If my tv had a AUX plug I wouldn't have to do all this. So far so good. Easy to set up. Working fine. Love that I can print from iPhone. Hope it lasts 10 years like my last one. I like it, it dose pick up a lot of channels and has a great picture to it but at times it dose go in and out so make sure you have it near a window or a outside wall it works better, but overall am very happy with it. This movie is AWESOME!!!! It's super entertaining . I recently purchased this product for my parents being that they are about to retire they want to be able to take the internet with them since they will split time between winter and summer homes now. They didn't have away of watching stuff online movies etc besides there ipad and kindle they love being able to stream stuff on their tv now. Very happy with this product. Works completely as advertised. It's small, almost not noticeable. Just plug it into a USB port. To go with the adapter, I also purchased a JBL Flip speaker for my setup. My laptop speakers are low quality; the JBL speaker is set up to play in priority over those. The adapter enables the speaker to produce great music / sound from iHeart Radio and other net sources. Couldn't be happier. This case works great for the Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro. This is another gem from director David O Russell. Needed a not too big TV for the corner of our den. This was a perfect choice! This is a great deal for a 16 GB SD Card. I would recommend. Its a really good product and great price and the setup was really easy, would recommend to all my friends and family. Very good camera for the $$$\n",
        "Easy to use\n",
        "Takes excellent pictures This tablet is great for meetings/conferences. I was able to use it to add notes to the course materials provided in pdf format at the last conference I attended. The size of the tablet is great - not so large that it is burdensome to carry, but large enough for easy reading and typing as needed. Its pretty fun I would definetly say its better then 1 and 2 graphics are great also. Even if you are not a Glee fan this album is worth buying. Every song is powerful, emotional, soulful. Based on the lyrics it would appear that some of the album was written before her boyfriends death &amp; some after. The songs \"after\" speak of finding strength to move on &amp; really pull on your emotional strings. Other songs are great club &amp; dancing arrangements. Lea's vocal ability is really let lose, you get to see that she is an even better singer then what you hear on Glee. I can not wait for more from her. Buy if you like strong female vocalist/pop singers, or just great music. this was our first time buying it so I am curious to see how long it will last. I've always been a Xbox fan &amp; the new system gives you so much. The visual experience is amazing but it's a bit creepy that it knows you when you walk in the room. Looking forward to new games to come out. I have never been a fan of external drives until now. This works so easy. I bought the first for my expansive Itunes collection &amp; have bought more so I can put all the family photos &amp; videos from CD's &amp; DVDs to the drive. I use one for all my business files. Now I have plenty of hard drive space so my laptop works better then ever. Happy with it works the way its supposed to. Its a great little deal ! Works great so far. It's a pretty simple machine - no fancy features - but I just wanted a basic scanner for business receipts, paperwork, etc, so it's a good fit. I run all over at work in construction management and with the kids after that....this is a lifesaving product! I was skyptical as to how this game would be, I can now say that after school when I am done with my study I cannot wait to get back to playing this game, my nephews and I have a great time playing this on weekends and during the week days or when we get the chance. I just love how the maze like scenes make the game a challenge to a point and as well that it is continues zombie action. This is a great console! I haven't purchased one in years and I am glad that I chose the PS4! This console seems to get better everyday as my wife and I find more uses for it! We love our PS4! Needed to upgrade my modem for the faster internet package i purchased through my ISP. This was priced right, easy set up and reliable speeds. I was surprised by Knack. I got the game mostly as something my wife and I could play together. Don't believe the reviews, I loved this game! It did have a predictable story, but the gameplay was awesome! I was surprised at how difficult normal difficulty was for this game! Definitely one to add to your collection. The replay-ablitiy is great as well. The game opens up after you beat it once! Awesome! This movie brings you into a silent world filled with the perils of space travel and technology mishaps. The views of earth from space are breath taking when combined when with some of the best use of 3D ever. This movie is a 90-minute roller coaster ride from beginning to end. Must be seen in 3D to be appreciated. I purchased this for our church as a backup desktop for our worship computer and primary computer for the pastor. We had a long list of requirements for performance. It fit all our needs and a few extra. The performance is great and the value fit our budget. I USE THESE EVERY DAY AND HAVE SHOWED THEM TO 25 PEOPLE SO FAR THEY ALL AGREE OUTSTANDING PRODUCT!!!!! I love these head phones, the sound and bass qualty is perfect for all my rock and metal music, as well when I am listening to my lectures from class, these headphones provide a very comfortable and blocks out unwanted noise so I can hear my music clear and perfect. I have no complaints as to how these headphones are working for me. This is a great case for the small Samsung Galaxy Tablet.\n",
        "The tablet is held securely and all controls can be accessed.\n",
        "There is a secure strap closure and a holder for a stylus.\n",
        "It is well made and does not have a cheap appearance.\n",
        "Nicer case than some of the more expensive ones. Great TV for the price ($169). Both my grandkids now have one and both love them. Mainly used to video games and movies. While the sound is like many flat screens, meaning mediocre, sounds as good as one I paid quite a bit more for. the lack of wifi at home was happyly fixed with this router This TV has amazing picture quality and the sound is very good as well however, if you are a gamer like me this TV is not for you. For some strange reason the PS3 and this Vizio model do not get along. When the Playstation is ideal the TV will just flicker and it is very annoying. Also on my older model I was able to turn the TV on just by turning on my playstation but when I did that same feature with this model the glitches became even worse. Also the remote is not a great universal remote even though is states this. Maybe it does not like the direct tv genie. Overall beside this the tv is great. This set of cooking pans is awesome. The non-stick surface is great for cooking and clean up. I have found that using this device is great with my nephews and my daughter, and as well listenig to the great sound qualty this device has, with it's many EQ presets such as Rock, Bass Boost, etc. I frequantly use my mp3 in the gym and is very gym friendly as well I use this device during my intense jogging sessions, I am amazed as to how this device does not interfere with my gym apprearl. I love it and it is nice for the kids. I like to watch movies and search internet. Really enjoying this product. Making it nice to save games Good lightweight cover nice if it had a place to slide a stylus in to keep with it Bought this primarily for playing games that require solid graphics support, which this has. I installed a 256GB SSD after buying it, and now it boots to Windows 8.1 in about 15 seconds from a cold start. It simply flies. I've been playing Thief 2014 on it, and the graphics are stunning. Bought an HDMI cable and an xbox-style controller, and use a 47\" high def TV as a monitor. Gaming heaven. Very happy with this, and the 18 month same-as-cash made it an easy way to upgrade. In the past Apple products have been reliable, so that's why we went back to iMac. Have yet to prove they are still dependable since we've only owned this a month or so. Wish it had a cd burner-it is available for purchase separately. Wish the keyboard it came with had a numbers pad.\n",
        "One annoying thing that is noticeable now, is the mail app is very slow retrieving mail from our cox account. I don't know why, but things will be sent to me at a time I know they've been sent, and it can be well over 30 minutes before I get them - even when checking mail every minute or so.\n",
        "We are hoping the reliability will make it worth the extra that it cost to purchase an Apple. am always needing batteries for around the house and always buy the multi-pack we were looking to spend at least $50.00 on one cable which we weren't real crazy about so this was a great surprise! we are very happy with our purchase like the iPad smaller size and clear screen does get smudged up if you do not use a stylus Exactly what I expected. I would definitely use the deal of the day again. The movie feels like it is an extended scene from another movie. This movie is not the typical disney movie and my children have watched this three times already and still love it as if it were their first time. A more in depth view into Loki and Thor. A must see for a true fan. I had to replace a humidifier and searched for one that wasn't to expensive or too cheap. This one wasn't the cheapest but I believe you get what you pay for. This one usually gets filled every day and a half. It puts out a nice amount of mist and is very adjustable. I haven't taken it down yet but seems like easy to maintain. I'm sure it will last for several years. needed a second/back-up battery for my camera and this one works great I've been a fan of Archer since the first airing of episode one on FX. This show is highly addictive. Not sure I can find 50 characters this is a review of a music CD. Always loved the Beatles and this is some of there best! I bought this headset because I heard playing video games was great with surround sound headsets. Initially I saw that they can get very expensive. When I came across the PX4's during my research I was skeptical at first because of the mixed reviews. Some people had complaints, while others loved them, so I decided to try them out on my own. The setup is not as bad as some say. I mean seriously, its two cables that connect to the back of your PS4 and a few setting changes. Initially I was discouraged about having to plug into my controller, but that's one of the features that got me excited about the PS4 in the first place. Anyway the sound is great once you figure out how you want your setting. I like bass when gaming and these do the job for me. YOU CAN BE MISLED if you are not listening/playing something with high quality sound! I was \"testing\" my set and was a bit upset before figuring that out. I love being able to hear footsteps when playing COD!!! It definitely gives me an advantage. Friends of mine said that the mic sounded good as well. When it comes to movies, they sound good too! The bass was deep and better than I initially expected. Did I mention I can mute the tv and play games with full surround sounds without waking my fiance??? All that being said I like the PX4's. The music from this movie is really great. The voices are amazing and Indina Menzel is one of the greats! She makes \"Let it Go\" come alive and hit home. This is fine. It was also cheaper than an Otterbox. I love this flash because it is eliminate using the pop up flash on my camera an the harsh glare that that causes. It allows me to put the light wherever I want it. Works great and the best part of having this is that we do not have to pay a huge cable bill every month. Of course we don't have 200 channels to pick from but we do have the local channels. My family enjoyed this movie. The acting was great. I have to watch it again, just to see if I missed anything. Sometimes, it's better, the 2nd time around. The only thing, we were looking for someone to greet her or to find her, when she walked onto the beach. She went through so much and to just see someone, anybody.... The case works as well as some more expensive name brands. Great protection for the price. Sound quality is great, but the ear buds get uncomfortable if worn for extended periods. Excellent quality filter providing optimal color toning. Sooth turning ring makes changing polarizing angle easy. Fits easily - and works very well. Will definitely use again. I like the look of this fridge as well as the space it has. However, it is super noisy - everything about it. It is loud when the compressor kicks on and loud when the ice is getting ready to drop. I couldn't hear my last fridge at all..only when it was going out. This fridge sounds brand new what my last one sounded like when the compressor was going out. That is super annoying. Works well for the price. Wish it was available in more colors. The store did not carry any other colors, even online. Great movie that continues the Marvel Universe saga. Great extras and behind the scenes looks at the making, deleted scenes and character bios. Great addition for anyone that has followed the Marvel movies. Loves how the story line continued based on Part 1 Glad to have purchased this product. Works well and was easy to place! John Carpenter at his best. This movie will always stay in my top 5 favorite Sci~Fi/Horror movies. very easy to use color coded, just about anyone can hook this up, if your not color blind, that is :) Easy to place and fits well. Has helped with scratches. It comes with different sizes of fittings and earbuds look cool! Has a lot of ambient noise so don't buy if looking for noise canceling. Love using it since we have several tablets and plugs fit rather well. An excellent addition to the series. Looks like Blizzard did some polishing as well. This was such a great price bundled with my camera. Its compact and protects my camera. Holds my memory cards and extra battery I tried out a lot of keyboards before I founds this one and I'm glad I held out for this one. Love the feel of this keyboard. This keyboard is perfect for setting up on a tray table on the train or an airplane. The backlit keys are great for the dim lighting on the train. Would recommend this to anyone. Great cinematography, action and character development. Great deal on this extra battery bundled with my camera. I can take my camera on vacation and not worry about running out of power. Extra battery was very useful. A must have for getting the best out of your Tv, very simple to use, just plug it in. might need to set up the inputs, but that's easy. I love this ink for my printer. Great value for the money!!!! This was a great price bundled with the camera. No issues storing all my pictures and videos on there. Love our soda stream! So much cheaper than buying sodas at the grocery store and tastes great! Great Purchase. Great Product. Great Service. I love the daily specials. Just looking to upgrade to a bigger TV, it has great pic quality. I've enjoyed having the ipad air. The weight of it makes all the difference for someone with arthritis in the hands. Good quality for a reasonable price. Simple to use and fits my nees. Calibration with ver. 1 firmware was difficult. This is a great product. Bought this for my 4yr old and my 1yr old and they love it. Good compact set of speakers, can't bet the price! has headphone jack too. Bought for my 4yr old and 1 yr old and they love it! Product is exactly what is needed for my printer. Ease of use and great quality Love it! I liked it a lot . there is going to be a 3rd movie. cant wait to buy the next one. It had a lot of CG in it but it was very good. I would like to see more deleted scenes. This charger is good; It works. However, the stand feels a little cheap in terms of plastic build and the batteries will only charge if you put them in the controller and put the controller on the stand; you can't just put the pack on there and continue to use the controller with regular batteries until it's charged. I haven't had experience with any other chargers, but I would say there are better ones out there. That being said, the batteries charge fairly fast (only 2-3 hours, from 0%) and they last over 15 hours of play, at least.  the music is clear. Like Dre said \" You hear very beat of the music\". Every feature is Apple expertise top of the mark outstanding. Been a PC person from the beginning yet, the ipad caught my attention and eventually, proved to be the best choice in it's category. The Retina Display is dynamic , visually enhanced and ipad has the potential to serve as the most essential device in a person's life. It does it all.\n",
        "Will take me a bit to master this ipad. There is a lot to learn, it's an Apple= I'm PC. I would like to review this item again when I'm more knowledgeable, lived with it for a while. i would recommend this movie to other movie viewers. The quality of this tv and the price were perfect. Nothing to complain. Good price and value, great deal. Uncensored episodes make the storylines much more funny and real. This is a good solid protection for my smartphone. Using this I am not limited to the K-Cups available online or in the store. Phone is great! I'm learning as i go as this is my first smartphone. Lots of options and capabilities that I'm not even aware of yet. The water reservoir is easy to fill and the K-Cups are easy to insert and remove. This pair of ear-buds are the best I have ever owned. Super comfortable for extended daily wear and the sound is GREAT!!! Purchased this oven as a mothers day gift for my mom to replace a 15 yr old kitchenaid she had. Due to the small footprint of the kitchenaid I was very limited in my options for replacement. Given I was at my budget and could not fit the LG (to complete her set of LG appliances) without modifying the opening I settled on the frigidaire due to its price and similar design to LG. Man am I glad I chose this oven. Since I had it installed my mom has been cooking up a storm and she has nothing but a glowing assessment of the oven. So positive in fact that I had to write a review for it. Judging by the quality of the build, lightning fast heat times (a little over 5 minutes to preheat to 350), and even convection cooking I could not be happier that I chose this model. I'm a bit angry I just purchased Samsung appliances for my own home, my oven takes at least twice as long to heat and cooks no where near as evenly. The next time I shop for an appliance Frigidaire(and their parent company Electrolux) will be the first place I look. Finally a bonus is all of their appliances are manufactured in the USA...enough said. This was a great find for me I am very happy with the ease of function. The quality is there and it has so many cool features! For someone who is not super tech minded I was amazed how quick I figured it out. The camera is very nice quality front and rear facing makes it more versatile for selfies :) I like that I can enlarge the text or picture with just a finger motion. I am sure I will discover more things I love as I continue to explore the features and apps. This literally is the best laptop I have ever used. It is built tough and I actually enjoy my time using it. I love the Dell brand and this laptop just reaffirmed my dedication. I took this to replace a 24\" Samsung that died after 7 days and I am extremely pleased with it. The color and response times are excellent for a monitor in this price range and it is very attractive, matching my other components quite well. It comes with two small rear facing speakers with limited response but I use a Bose sound system and turned them off right away. Set up was easy using HDMI (there are two inputs) but the on screen feature and mode adjustments are confusing. Naturally there is no paper instruction manual included (just charge ten cents more and put a copy in the box) but you can go to AOC and read it online. For daily use, \"moderate gaming\" and watching movies I can't fault it at all. I am very pleased with my new printer. It was a good price and just what I was looking for! My last personal experience was Windows XP so anything is better than what we had! Easy to install and very user friendly and great protection I must admit we moved from an old Windows X\n",
        "P to this unit and the learning curve is high! Great for the price and moves fast and easy to go from laptop to tablet Good version of a known story. The cinematography looks good as well with nice tone to the picture. Overall, great camera for all your outdoor/vacation activities.\n",

        "-underwater shots (take this while kayaking/fishing)\n",
        "-selfies -who doesn't like taking selfies with your S.O when on vacation or out? it beats asking a stranger to take the pic for you and with its wide angle- the pic looks great.\n",
        "-for taking pics of something positioned in a difficult angle\n",
        "\n",
        "Besides that, the picture quality is quite nice and I love the scene/artistic features of it. I own the Canon S95 which I believe to be a nice camera but I love how multifunctional this one is. I'm surprised there aren't any reviews on it already! This movie will really keep your interest from start to finish. Be sure to watch the first one, of course. Purchased this after accidentally vacuuming the cord on the original sensor bar. Works flawless Love games good for online gaming to play with friends and family and people you don't know. Works well... Helps me to get good clarity during Night photography, waterfall shots. The stereo is far the greatest Kenwood stereo I have own many features that help make your sound system sound great. Features such as 7 band equipment, as speaker size selection. The stereo also lets you control the Hz on every speaker low and high. I would recommend it for anyone who is looking for good sound quality. The product came in very handy with my camera. Now, I can store a lot more pictures. This camcorder delivers high quality, user friendly and professionally captures all those meaningful events and makes them last a lifetime! GREAT PHONE!!! I COULDNT HAVE MADE A BETTER CHOICE. Loads up well and cleaned out any virus that was in the C drive and made things great again. Easy to use and load up in system. my grandsons loved the game so much, kept them busy. This TV is great! The colors, sharpness and motion are fantastic. The only downside is the tv is very reflective. Far worse than the Panasonic I had. It's not an issue at night but during the day it can be very distracting. bought for Samsung tv installed easily and is perfect for what I need I would recommend this series to anyone who wants a good laugh. The series has a good plot and funny characters! Overall this a good movie, good acting and storyline. My 34 yr old son loved the game but not good for kids. Loved every minute of this movie, made you laugh and cry. Personally I cannot stand using a touch screen keyboard for typing out texts and emails, but with the current market I was kind of forced into getting that since every current phone seems to have it. Not really the phone's fault since it was designed as that, but it's a bit of a pain to type on and the auto correct is something awful. The pre-loaded apps it has on it are also really confusing to go through and manage, it's like 4 pages worth of stuff I'll never use! Apart from the mouse and layout, good key board.\n",
        "I like it, so a good buy for the price Bought this for my basement TV and am happy with the value of the product. This has to be one of the best cases ever!! tough, but it didn't add too much bulk to the iPad. I bought this screen to go with an Epson projector. It was part of a basement renovation I did. Wow. The quality of the screen is amazing. It brings out the best of my projector. Even with all the light on the picture is crystal clear. I'm very happy with my purchase and would recommend not going for a lesser quality screen. Bought these speakers to use for social gatherings by hooking up to my laptop. Sound quality is good and the set up looks good. It has a good battery life.\n",
        "good screen size and good speakers. Purchased this game for my nephews. They enjoyed the game very much The iPad air is so amazing. Everything loads so fast &amp; getting around is so easy. This is a great value for the money: the original classic plus the newest one. The newest one got a bum rap, but in my opinion, it didn't deserve that. I enjoyed it just as much as the first four. It's a great tv, easy to setup, connects to the internet. I purchased this item for my Son's IPad as he was using some he had purchased at Amazon.com and they were difficult to apply evenly and gave him bubbles on the screen. He is visually challenged, so this made it difficult for him to read things and was constantly getting scratches from using the pen for tapping and scrolling. The only thing that bothered me about this product was that he had to be without the IPad for 24 hours while the cover set up. anyone with kids should buy this lunch box @a great price to.\n",
        "thanks again BB Season 6 was by far the most interesting and some plot twists I didn't even anticipate. i bought this for my wife and she loves it. she is a hospital manager and the watch is very helpful due to the accessibility. the features are well put together and easy to use and access. it is also fun, and she says that a lot of people ask her about it, and they are impressed also Good guy triumphs over evil and gets the girl! Is Loki really gone? Titanfall is a game from the guys who used to make Call of Duty back when it was good. I feel this game surpasses CoD on it's entertainment factor. It's just a heck of a lot of fun to get in a titan and just start mowing people down with it's chain-gun and missiles! This is a good router, I use it for a smart tv, laptop, tablet, phone, and a 3DS game system This is my first tablet and I am really excited to get this samsung product. At first I wanted to get an apple ipad air but after reviews and comparisons I decided to go with the note pro. Metallica created a true piece of art with this album. Another Metallica Masterpiece. I have been impressed with the router. It transfers data fast and is reliable. Plenty of space left after backing up computer, used primarily to store gaming software. One of the best films that nobody has ever seen with a good story and violence that doesn't seem forced. I love the way it turns on and off the screen. It is very easy to remove, and the magnets are strong. This iPad is very lite and easy to type on. I love the face time I have a 50 inch Panasonic plasma and a 46 inch led samsung 8000 series. This 65 inch blows them all away with a crystal clear picture and a quad core processor that let's you connect to the internet in seconds. I would rate it a 12 out of 10!! it only comes with 2 pairs of glasses...bad show Samsung. The salesman at the store was very helpful and a pleasure to work with. I like that the ink is in the multi pack and that I get a discount for being a reward member. The picture and screen size is great for viewing games and movies. The speaker phone could be louder. I love the USB 3.0 because it allows me to fully charge the battery in about 2 hours instead of the 6+ with the standard USB 2.0 system. This movie is basically a remake of the Superman story, but it is told in a fresh way, with Superman's character played as happy go lucky, instead of the serious Superman that we have seen in the past. This product was definitely worth the extra expense. It is very versatile enables me to protect my phone and clip inside or outside my pocket. It is neutral in color so looks professional no matter what you are wearing. The clip is really heavy duty so it stays put. I got this SD card with my Samsung tablet. It was easy to install and easy to save things I want to keep right to it. I love having all the extra memory and no worries about losing anything. This is a really good tablet with a great camera. If you are interested in pictures, the camera beats the IPad mini. It's lightweight and easy to maneuver. great cover for the mini. helps with protection if you drop the mini This is a good product. I like it so much that I bought 1 for my son &amp; 1 for his girlfriend. It keeps your laptop much cooler by cycling the air with 2 fans but it plugs into 1 of the USB ports draining the battery somewhat quicker, not terribly though! It is still a good pad even if you do not plug it in. This goes EVERYWHERE our laptop goes! The first 1 I had my kids broke the USB cable, even though it tucks away nicely. this was a free item with my mini.nice protection. It takes great pictures, has a lot of memory and is easy to access any programs you want. It is a good size for Facebook and everything is clear. It is quick to go to different programs and has many uses both personal and for business use. I keep all appointments in it and it keeps me up to date. I have Samsung Note II cell phone and I like being able to interchange different things that I do. My daughter has watched this DVD everyday since I bought it for her! Purchased as part of a birthday gift. Great sound and they are very comfortable to wear in your ears. I couldn't be happier with the picture quality on this television. The stand with the two legs in my opinion looks nicer and is way more stable then the single pole stands . My kids love the Netflix interface on the television and most importantly my wife love the way it looks as well. If you are deciding between the UQ model and a lower model I would go with the UQ model. The extra sub , contrast ratio and aluminum bezel are enough to justify the price for me. Oh and if I didn't say this already, this set it is AMAZING! I've used it a handful of times. I got rid of my smoothie maker because it wasn't breaking up the ice cubes. This one does a great job. great cds for downloaded music. great quality indeed. Great movie for kids entertaining all the wwe stars scooy-doo fun to watch for the hole family Buy this panel to my tv about 4 months ago and I am truly satisfied my room now recommend todorealmente easy installation, great support and elegance. This has been a terrific product, I got it in 2 colors and its a very sturdy and durable case and looks GREAT also. it;s nice to watch all my old favorite cartoons on dvd anytime i want It does everything that I want it to do. It comes with Chrome and Google play. Works just like a laptop computer, yet it's compact. I really like this product although the speakers went out within a week of purchase. Had it changed under warranty and so far its good.. we are happy. Great colorful product. Nice looking and plastic is sturdy. I have only had the camera few weeks, but it has worked great right out of the box. Very easy to setup and start taking great pictures. The camera is also compact compared to the other models, which is nice when you have it around your neck all day. This is my 3rd Canon camera and it has lived up to my expectations. it's great to see all my favorite cartoons again on dvd Excellent Gaming keyboard, went from a normal membrane keyboard to this one with it's proper cherry MX switches, and it's night and day... I can touch type much more cleanley, there's a satisfying button press and stroke on each key. The keyboard lights up great, and I can isolate WASD and arrow keys.\n",

        "Great quality and feel, and I know it will last as long as my old logitech's which have given me years of great service.\n",

        "Great gaming keyboard for those who like Cherry MX switches. This was my first desk purchase top in over a decade and I wanted something really nice, as well as already loaded with Windows 8.1. This is an impressive piece of hardware with far more features than I am ever likely to use. Speed is incredible and the graphics are outstanding so that only hardcore gamers might want more power. There is plenty of memory so unless you do video editing you will be just fine. The cabinet is quite attractive and not nearly as large as it looks in the photos. It runs very quietly and stays cooler than I had expected, although I do run an auxiliary off one of the front USB connections. he only issue is the lack of USB connections at the rear; there are only four and all are USB2. Figuring a keyboard, mouse, my Bose sound system, web camera/microphone, and the printer...Well, it come up short. The printer and the Bose system won't run well (the Bose not at all# off a USB hub and the wireless mouse also dislikes it. Realistically two more USB connectors in the back would be fine but four more would be even better! There are two USB2 and two USB3 connections in the front as well as the DVD/Blue ray device, along with headphones and microphone connections, all of which can be neatly covered by the sliding door giving a smooth and attractive look to the unit #although my girlfriend claims it looks like a refrigerator!#. Set up was easy; it booted and loaded right up and was ready to use in just minutes. I currently connect a 27\" #HDMI# in landscape, a 17\" #VGA# monitor in portrait as well as a 24\" HDTV #HDMI), all with no issues and I think it will support even more displays than that if you need them. For daily use this is way above anything that you'd ever need but for guys like myself who just like neat toys, watch movies and play games at a moderate level it impossible to find fault with it, save the need for more USB connections. The mouse and keyboard are very average and since chances are you will be using your own devices so they are not worth discussing. Bought it for my hubby when his broke. He loves it. Happy Hubby Happy Life;-) For any hard come gamer: its the top of the line computer (which already comes prebuilt!!) that you can own. Great quality parts and amazing internal hardware. My Lenovo laptop does Yoga! The top folds completely around and under to turn it into a tablet. The touch screen is the only way to go with Windows 8. I have no complaints after one month of using the Lenovo! I bought it to replace an old phone I had and needed a certain type of base that this one has, so no problem switching with my old one. The hand set is smaller and slimmer which I like,has caller id,clarity in the sound and an outstanding price.So I am pleased with my purchase Huge Disney fan. Went into this movie thinking it was a comedy. Though it certainly had its dramatic moments, it was exactly what I would have hoped for in a Disney movie. Great story. And the actors were flawless!!! The card is doing exactly what it needs to be doing. Disney outdid themselves with this one! My new favorite Disney film! Easy to use, shredder and shreds documents as described. This now classic movie has great acting by Steve Martin and Michael Caine, and the premise is light hearted and fun. Can't go wrong with this movie! I'm enjoying all that I do on it. It's all good for the books and games I play on it.  Great environments and engaging characters. Game Play makes you want to replay levels. The Bosch Dishwasher is extremely Quiet. Past dishwasher was so loud that the noise constantly interfered with our dinner and conversation in our kitchen. We now have peace and quiet. We should have made the change years ago. The third rack in this dishwasher is an excellent feature. We like the display controls on the front of the dishwasher. This dishwasher seems to hold a lot more items than our past one. Bought this to go with my IPAD and its great! Makes typing and chatting easy. Battery life if sensational and lasts even longer if you turn the backlight off. My only complaint is that the chord that they give you to charge it with is less than like 8 inches... Its a universal plug though so I was able to use a longer one that I had here at the house. Other than that. It's great! Great tv. Good color and picture quality. Needs to be used with a sound bar for better sound. Regular speakers sound like they are in a well. Sound bar or surround sound are necessary. Happy with the new Office used word to make my 10 year old son's birthday invite, very easy to use! Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro, Tom Sizemore,\n",

        "believable plot lines.\n",

        "I would also recommend \"Straight Time\" with Dustin Hoffman\n",
        "and\" Collateral\" With Tom Cruise and Jamie Fox This movie, despite all the adult clips in it, is worth watching. Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a great job in the dual role of actor and director. This was the first time I had ever seen Tony Danza in a movie; his character was good and funny too. Scarlett Johannson...she's so pretty! I loved her in this movie; her character was good too. All in all, very much worth it. Bought this for the wife to play with. She didn't want a regular sized IPAD and chose this for its smaller size. She absolutely loves it. It's quick and works great! This is a great printer for the price. The setup was easy and the features work exactly as they should. Could have been better, but overall a good movie. Was able to learn a little more about Mandela through this movie. R.I.P Mediba. Picked this up to help with school. I am a petroleum engineering student and load videos of lectures, as well as notes on here for viewing and studying on the go. I also grabbed the Zagg keyboard to go with it. Picked this IPAD up for $300 and could not be happier with my purchase. My son picked out this mouse because of the color. He also chose this because of the shape of it. He likes the way if fits his hand. My Apple iPad Air, is safe against damage and folds into a stand. I love the dvd drive, it is very small and compact so it doesn't take up a lot of room. It was easy to use the first time. Just plug in and watch your movie. Great value Once I understood I needed to upgrade my power supply along with the video card installation went fine but things were a little cramped. I should have searched for the upgraded drivers for a Windows 8.1 machine but after some problem solving that was made to work also. I installed this in a system that runs my golf simulator. I went from frequent system crashes and slow loading to great performance. Great value for the money. Bought it as a gift for my son and he likes it fine. It has the older interface so he can use it with a new phone when he upgrades. I bought this camera for a two week trip to the Amalfi Coast in Italy. It worked wonders, and I took a ton of photos. Loved the first Hunger Games. Became a bigger fan after the 2nd movie. Waiting eagerly for the 3rd. If you are not Hunger Games fan, you will become one after seeing the movie. This is a great addition to my iPad. I can write with a finer line and, while my notes are on the iPad, I always have a pen ready for use in signing other papers, writing a paper memo (who does that anymore?) etc. Even though the science of the movie seems to be way off fact, the visual images of space are outstanding. I needed a keyboard for Church and this was priced low and then when I went to the cashier it was even less. This game is pretty awesome to play with friends and was also great for online game play. But as of May 20th this year nintendo is doing away with that feature. Regardless of this fact, I still really recommend this game as it's very fun to play, and it's all about your strategy. It's an Apple product, what more could I possibly say! Keeps my iPhone 5s safe on the go and durable protection against damage. The ultrathin rubber edging helps my phone secure. The movie was so awesome in theaters, that we had to buy it on Blu-Ray. Bought this to keep my favorite games up to date. I've had it for awhile but I find for me personally the controls are hard to adjust to on the wii console. Don't let this discourage you; it is a good game overall though. If the screen pivoted up and down, this would have been a great monitor. Instead its only good Overall, it's a great product! I haven't had any issues so far. This is good buy for the price and use wise. Portable, Handy and sleek. This game brought back memories. I glad they updated and oldie but a much needed goodie. You can play with up to 4 people I believe. It's different but it definitely makes it fun. The MP3 player itself was very easy to set up and begin use. The coolest feature that I've used so far has been using the radio to listen to local stations. I was skeptical about this artist at first but overtime I started to like the lyrics/message. The sound is kinda different than whats out there. I think Lorde is someone we should keep our eye. Bought this game pack for $20. 5 games in the set, can't beat that deal. Never played GOD of WAR games before, and found them to be very engrossing. had a hard time putting the controller down Have used flash memory cards for years, very impressed with the value and quality performance that I continue to get with Sandisk memory cards. High speed performance matches my camcorder flawlessly. We use this for monitoring our home while we are at work. We like the ability to see what is happening at home right on our phones.. The cameras are small enough not to be an eye sore. Easy set up, small fee for picture/video storage. Well worth the money. Did not want to spend a lot for this home computer Monitor, but wanted value for nonetheless. AOC Monitor is perfect for my needs. I usually don't get hooked on movie soundtracks but myself and my family really loved this soundtrack so I had to buy it. This is one of my favorite shows, it has a great plot, and great character development throughout the series. Easy to use thus far, but still trying to get use to it. Very helpful. Andrew (concierge #108) at customer service was great and helped me through an issue I had. I really like the small size and adaptability of this micro/mini-HDMI adaptor. Easily transportable in camera bag and looks cool too! So glad I purchased it; fast charges and holds a charge for an extended amount of time. Perfect fit for my iphone 5S. I love this case. I've had an iPhone for 3 years and this is my first Samsung phone. I bought this case last month. I love the color, teal and White, as is different than anyone else's. It can hold the cards or money in the slot in the back which in love. As a new mom, I put my license, credit card and money in the slot and stick it in her car seat or stroller. It's convenient andi don't need to carry a wallet or purse. I love it! The filter is easy to assemble, a decent price for a brand name filter. It has lasted over two months and I use the water filter daily overall I would recommend it, it is very portable. I always go to hit the apostrophe and end up hitting return instead because it's different. It would be nice if it came in additional colors. It would be really sweet if there was a case built into it for protection. The keys are nice and comfortable. Overall it is good. Good length and works well. Bought at a good time to be used with some new HDMI devices that I had just received. Added the gift card to my online purchase without any problems. I will probably get more in the future since I wanted to limit how many online places that I used my payment info for. I needed for school projects so now I can look at several things at once The expansion (along with the new patch) got me completely hooked on Diablo 3 all over again. If you haven't played in a while and were on the fence about playing again with the expansion, just do it. Get it now. Totally worth it. Love the design. Good sound for price. Comfort is okay Super game. I really enjoy it. Best game that I have played. I use these everyday for hours on my home PC, Apple, and Android devices and they sound great everywhere I go. I went to the store to check out the Beats Solo's and ultimately went home with these. The overall design is very attractive and build quality is quite nice. The white headphones and gold connector match my gold iPhone 5s quite well. The sound is crisp and clear. They tend to make audio sound as if it's a live performance which is a nice effect. I also use them frequently to make phone calls and works perfectly for that. They don't pump out crazy bass but it's enough that's effectively noticeable and still sounds great. I would have liked a little more bass but I can live with it. The coiled cable is a nice plus when tucking the cable under my shirt. They're more durable than I expected so far after about 4 months of daily usage. I can fall asleep while wearing them and they haven't broken yet. The faux leather material holds up pretty well as well as the stitching that holds it together. Since I got the white model, the color on the cable has become a little dingy which can be expected for white materials but the actual headphones still look beautiful and crisp white. They feel good on my head but can get uncomfortable after long periods of usage. Taking breaks after a while is probably recommended but I just readjust them and they feel better. Overall I'm extremely satisfied with these and they were cheaper than what I was planning to spend. They're perfect for disappearing into my music or as a hands free mobile solution. Great lens for sports and bird watching. Close ups are so easy and clear. I'm a beginner and if I can use it anyone can. I bought this item almost a month ago,and I have not had any problems with it. The best part is that it comes with Office preinstalled, and it is a great benefit for a student. I haven't had any troubles with it yet. I would highly recommend it. However, I dont like how you can't download firefox or chrome. I am extremely happy with this tv...there are better pictures and tv's with better options but at this price I couldnt find anything to compare....Would purchase again tommorow. I actually went to BB for the model prior to this model and it was out of stock. I was dissatisfied when the sales person told me this model was no longer going to be sold, but failed to mention a newer model was replacing it. I had just purchased a new set of speakers and based on reviews decided to go with the Yamaha receiver. A day after I called another BB and the sales person told me they just got in the newer model. I have to say after the initial disappointment, I am happy I ended up with this model. All of the audio options and set up is excellent. The unit has more than enough HDMI connections for all my audio equipment. The sound is great, so grateful for all the reviews. While the set up is easy, I did not care for the electronic user manual although I have a green thumb and can appreciate it. What's not to love about Dark Souls 2? If you liked Dark Souls 1 you're going to enjoy Dark Souls 2. This is just a memory card for my camera. Nothing special to write about. This headset sounds great and I like that there is only one cord connecting to the controller; no need to connect to your TV or directly into the Xbox. This ink is very useful in my printer. It is easy to install and has good output. You get about 40 mins. of recording time on this card and that is in HD. For the price you can't beat it. It works great and has never given me any problems. this is so far a good tablet, easy to use and able to install many apps for free I was very interested in both the Gear 2 Neo and the Gear Fit, so I decided to try out both. To sum it up, the only advantage the Gear Fit has over the Gear 2 and Gear 2 Neo is the fact that it looks awesome and unique. Every function you can do on the Gear Fit you can also do on the Gear 2 Neo, plus a bunch more. A lot of reviews you read online will say there are barely any apps available for the Neo, but those reviews are outdated. I've had the Neo for about a week now and every day I check the app store - new apps have been added constantly. Some pointless, but some cool like the CNN app and a ton of different watch interfaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of my favorite things about the Neo is the fact that I can snooze and turn off my phone alarm from it. GREAT for those mornings when I cannot find my phone next to my bed, I can just swipe the screen on my wrist.\n",
        "\n",
        "Call quality is surprisingly good, I get a lot of use out of it because my work vehicle does not have bluetooth, so with my hand on the steering wheel I can drive and still talk on the phone if needed. I've asked others if they can hear me OK and they said they assumed I was talking through the phone not the watch. Only downside, talking through the watch does drain the battery which leads me to the next part.\n",
        "\n",
        "Battery life is OK, I've had to charge every two days with a decent amount of use, but charging doesn't take long at all, I just put the watch on the charger every other day while getting ready for work, usually fully charged within an hour. That may bother some people but doesn't bother me.\n",
        "\n",
        "Watch is pretty comfortable, for a smartwatch I don't think its too bulky. Lots of people complain about the strap saying its too cheap, I think its good, but if you don't like it you can swap it out for any .22 watch strap.\n",
        "\n",
        "At the gym, for some reason the pedometer does not pick up a lot of steps when running/walking on treadmill...when walking regularly during the day, it seems the pedometer picks up too many steps! I am using a Galaxy S3, which does not have S Health. Instead you get \"Fitness with Gear\" which is TERRIBLE. They really need to make S Health available for other devices if they are going to market this as compatible with other devices besides the S4 and S5. Granted, Samsung has released a few updates to get rid of some bugs in the software, but \"Fitness with Gear\" still has a long way to go before its even use-able.\n",
        "\n",
        "Also, you'll see a lot of complaints about having to \"START\" the Pedometer every day. THIS IS FALSE. Yes, you do have to start the pedometer when you first turn the Gear 2 Neo on, but that is the only time you need to Start it! No need to turn it off at night, so I don't know why people are complaining about turning it on and off all the time. It resets at midnight automatically. If you are too lazy to push a start button ONCE when you first get a new gadget, then you will need a lot more than a fit tracker to get yourself in shape (and unfortunately for S3 owners, you'll need a lot more than the Gear 2 Neo or Gear Fit no matter how lazy you are).\n",
        "\n",
        "In a nutshell, this thing is great as a smartwatch. Getting the notifications and calls from my phone are flawless and more convenient than I imagined. The watch pretty much has no use as a health tracker for now especially if you're like me with an older Samsung phone, but that can easily be changed with some software updates. If you like action move then this is a good one. Stallone and Arnold need I say more. Another great Leo movie, what more can I say! A must see!! The pixels are amazing on my tv! Love that I can now play Minecraft on my tv! I love the Ipad air. It is sleek in design and very light. It has all the apps you will need for social, games and anything else you want to do for business. Watching movies when you get the adapter for your tv looks amazing, blue ray quality. Maybe someday it will be true multitasking. when downloading a movie on amazon you have to stay on the app or it will pause your download. Great value for portable USB. Goes on my key chain so I have it when ever needed! Doing my part in saving the environment, one battery at a time! My 8 year old son loves the copter! When it crashes it just keeps going. Very durable. After getting it connected to our internet service, we were amazed how much better our internet ran. Have not had any problems putting the filter in or out. I have dyson DC26. I wanted to buy this product because of easy to use. I liked it very much. One of thing I don't like is air comming to my face while I'm vaccuing. It is very convinient. It is small and light. Power is strong enough. I wanted to buy for my parents but a little hard to use for old people. I like it for what I am using it for but it's hard to get turned off and have not figured out where some of the songs come from. Not on my download list. Good sound. i have used the printer several times and i can ready what is printed So far we really like it. Still playing with all the picture settings. I have dyson DC26. I wanted to buy this product because of easy to use. I liked it very much. One of thing I don't like is air comming to my face while I'm vaccuing. It is very convinient. It is small and light. Power is strong enough. I wanted to buy for my parents but a little hard to use for old people. l was looking for a camera that was easy to use and small enough to take on trips with great picture quality. This camera fits the bill. This TV was exactly what we were looking for. Great picture in High Definition, and size is perfect for our family room. I feel that after being removed from charger that it doesn't seem to keep a long charge. However, it is a piece that is needed for my Mac. I love giving the steam wallet cards to my son as gifts. It takes the guesswork out of gift giving for me and he can always find just the right game to buy with them. Makes my life easier, since I don't always know what the game of choice is at any given time. Bought this for my sons and they love it. Kid friendly but entertaining enough to keep everyone interested. I really enjoyed having all of these films in one collection. Has some pretty cool extra features as well. Great game, very challenging. Steel Case had to be mailed, but came in a very timely manner. No problems. It's easy to use. Prints out beautiful pictures. My 13 year old son was able to set it up by himself. I just love things from AVG. Very good programs. I will tell my friends about the product. I've read the story and thought they did a GREAT job following the books and still making the story stand. The acting was great and I enjoyed the movie alot. This TV replaced a Westinghouse in our Bedroom and so far it is a much nicer picture Bought this for my 14 year old tech savvy son. He loves it and it seems to work well with his iPhone 5. Over all I would recommend it to those who are curious as to how metal is supposed to be done aside from Judas Priest, Accept, Megadeth &amp; Loudness. PS Metallica is over rated. Emphasis mine. Hahahahaha! I have 3 insignias and haven't had a problem with any of them We got the iPad because my wife likes apple products and we have iPhones and macbook. It does what it is advertised to do, but I wish it had the options that other comparable tablets do. I think it is a bit expensive for its lack of options. I also do not like that it is meant to be for a single user (only one account linked to it). The screen resolution is fantastic and it does synch with other apple products, which is nice. Was hesitant in buying it because of the cost but the graphics are really good on the games. The games are no more expensive then the regular xbox 360 ones but disappointed that you cannot play the xbox 360 games on this system. I think this case is a great buy for the price. It's really portable and fits my WD My Passport drive perfectly. I purchased this and a 40 inch smart TV for my room.It was a little expensive but I loved the flexibility of the full-motion.\n",
        "It's also, sturdy. This is a good replacement headset for Xbox 360. It feels sturdier than the original Xbox 350 headset. The boom mic swivels down and straight up when you aren't using it and want it out of the way. The only bad part is it's only for the left ear as it doesn't swivel down if you put it on the right ear. If your a fan of the series this game is a little easier than the others but still great. If your new to the series this a great game to start with. Graphics are nice and gameplay has been refined. Very good product. Fast and reliable. No problems, compared to other products. needed to play online and update or share your games and join in with friends. always easy to set up and get started or continue on with library. online content is good but could be expanded.  Anybody who is a Disney fan will love this as it is an outstanding movie about the making of an all time classic,. Does great for me hope hp make it better first time hp fan and I like it I am not a fan of applying screen protectors on myself, due to the stress of the miniature bubbles that form after application. You pray to the screen protector gods in hopes that they will disappear after the protector dries - otherwise you get distracted and start trying to smush the bubbles away, risking the integrity of the screen protector. There is also the time consumption with aligning the protector to the phone without accidentally dropping part of the protector onto the phone and attracting dirt in the process.\n",
        "This screen protector was easy to apply! The screen protector kit comes in three layers. The first layer is the plastic film that protects the sticky part of the protector that you will peel off. Behind the middle layer of the actualprotector is an orange plastic guard. All you do is line up the orange plastic the film is on by turning it over, which literally takes a few seconds, and apply it. No waiting for it to dry, and it looks awesome and smooth. Definitely worth the extra bucks in my opinion. Overall this phone is amazing. It is a definite improvement form the S4 in many ways. Only complaint is that the menu button has a totally different function, so you now have to hold it down to get an in app menu. 2nd classic for me. love it very much. best ipod/mp3 hp makes a great monitor, HD is very good for PC video. Instead of having multiple mouse devices, this one mouse can switch back and forth. It's extremely portable and very quick to charge. I'd like it more if the click was quieter. Your mileage may vary. apple has great products, the ipad mini is fast and plenty big enough. you can't go wrong with it. Purchased for elderly mother's birthday and she has thoroughly enjoyed it. With only a bit of initial help from me, she has taken \"ownership\" of it and adds her own content, etc.\n",
        "A great present! This looks amazing on Bly ray. The picture looks so crisp. A must for 80's fans An excellent game staring Lightning that gets held down by the use of a time system in game. great product, since I bought, I have been operate about two month,\n",
        "excellent performance, quite , no noise, easy read icon, picture and article etc. much more... I like Chrome a lot. It allowed us to hook the bedroom tv up to broadcast youtube videos for the little one and watch Netflix without having to set up an old gaming system or blue ray just to stream. The only hitch was, I was unaware that it would not work with my original iPad (wife has a 2, so that works) I lost my phone, did not work with older android phone and does not work with Vista on my old laptop. I have not updated all my technology because we can do so much with the tablet's etc. Chrome made it sound like you can use any smartphone or tablet, but they meant ios 6 or later and after Window's vista... Still a good value, just something to be aware of. Kids and adults love this movie. Our Grandchildren and their parents know the songs by heart and sing along with the movie. One of the best Disney Movies in a long time. buy multiples for travel. cannot travel without several - don't run out of space I love this phone. Great Speed, Clarity, Graphics, Features, and Power. Comfortable bag with lots of pockets &amp; zippers and room for a computer as well. I have nothing much else to say, including the price is very good. I'm going to buy a more powerful one in the future! This mount is more expensive than the third party manufacturers, but it will perform as expected when used on a flat surface. I like the idea of having the stylus or a pen when I need them. Great for the price. I have had thee otter box on other phones and liked thee idea for the protection you have if you drop them. Considering the cost of replacement if you dropped it and had to replace it before your contract was up. I purchased my new stove b/c mine was very old. But I was scared to buy a glass top out of fear of it breaking or the cleaning, and the price. This stove is so easy to use, easy to clean. I love it! If you plan on taking your GoPro out to the water, you definitely should purchase this accessory. Great camera. Easy to use and store. clear pictures It is a great case. However, it protrudes the speaker. Only used a few times so far, worked great accurate even in remote area. This SanDisk memory card has performed as expected. This disc is awesome!heavy and hard with bonus disc included. The first Type cover had tap to drag functionality, which is standard on all laptops. That's good. The Type 2 Cover now supports it too. Though originally it didn't in Windows 8, one can get tap to drag easily and for free, in Windows 8.1 Yay!\n",

        "My dad loves this keyboard. It makes his tablet feel like a real productive machine. The trackpad might be small. Maybe the next one can have a larger mouse. I needed a replacement for the earphones that came with my Samsung Galaxy S4. I shopped around for many models but then I decided to go with this one because I mainly use it to listen to music and this one has three controls (Volume up, down, and play/pause) and a microphone. All for $22. It is a good deal. This bag is attractive and suitable for basic needs. I live in rural area and have a better reception on thee I phone. Like I've said above these subs have lasted me 8 years and to this day I am using them. Even without the lights the design of these are beautiful. My Olympus digital camera would not recharge with its original battery, the DigiPower rechargeable battery worked like a charm! Well done, excessive film about an excessive character. Nice product for the price.. Recommend instate of buying expensive cables unless using got very high quality tv pictures... cheap cheap cheap cheap lots of memory for the price .... Very good and safe product for lcd led screens.. I will recommend to purchase .. Not going to damage your screen....................................................\u2026............. good game overall.i like this game very much.no complaint. Works very well for all my games. I love it. I can play games late into the night or early in the morning without bothering my wife and child, who love to sleep! Nice to have essentially wireless in-game audio. VERY very simple to use, do the update (type xbox one controller update in Bing), and then use ANY (and I mean ANY) headphones to listen to game audio. Window's 8 stinks @ first but like any Comp you will learn how to use it .. HP ink is the best. XL cartridges make many more copies. Fun version of the all time favorites Mickey &amp; Minnie Easy to install, well built and has already protected my device from damage as a results of dropping. Game over all is pretty good not a fan of the game play at times. Works with new MS Power Cover, tested. Good since it has a nice leather feel. I would like to have had multiple angles, which might be possible with some sort of modification. With the new Surface FreedomCase, this Maroo feels larger while less protective. Even when attached, I'm glad my Surface Pro still fits in my Nixon Sleeve. great camera. great graphics. wouldnt recommend another phone. Ps4 awesome ! Game play was great. But their customer service is horrible. Still waiting on a issue to be resolved My research on this product proved to be true. It is a great vacuum for the price. It does was it was designed to do. Works great right out of the box, easy to use on multiple systems. Its a Pretty exciting game keeps me engaged for hours at a time My boyfriend and I play this game together all the time. We also play with other family members and friends. The difficulty levels are great and the game is very fun to play. This flash drive is fast. It is a little small in physical size so one should be careful of not dropping it from bag or other containers. Great 3d movie to watch with the grandchildren and the extra discs are nice for them to view on their blue-ray. What can I say that hasn't already been said? Phenominal game. Purchased this to help me change the memory inside my computer. It seemed to have got the job done. I haven't noticed any issues. Found it to be useful somewhat easy to use and setup This is a great video game. My kids really enjoy playing it. They talk about it all of the time. The album sounds liek something from the past but it was a sound that could be confused for a new style of music becuase ite has an epic appeal for good music. The lyrics are definetely soulful with a fun music backgroud for all ages. This has been a great extra battery - has long life and I have seen no drop in performance. Excellent as stand alone speakers for stereo or as front channels in a surround system. They sound as good if not better than other more expensive towers I've tested. Great camera for an advanced amateur. Not compatible with lenses we had for EOS10D. Good game. Better than the PS3 version. What else. Better than the PS3. I like the colors. What else. The phone has alot of new features and a great camera. I hope this great phone brings you the same joy I received from it\n",
        ". It compares to a blade shave without the occasional cuts. Also, a very long warranty period. I used to own the previous version of this remote that was good for its time and use. Eventually a move killed that one and I bought this one on sale. It's got all the old functions and more. The direction arrows seems more sturdy and it works with more devices than just the PS3 itself. Totally worth not having to use the system's controller. Journey was more than deserving of its game of the year status. Beautiful game that the family can enjoy. this drive is great for it's price. needs 2 usb ports. burned blueray on 10+ yr old xp computer. no software included for advanced burning or duplication, must use windows software or download third party. Fairly new to the Avett Brothers, recommended to me by my daughter. I thoroughly enjoyed the whole CD - nice mix of rock/pop/country throughout, very easy to listen to. I just love my new iPad Air!!! I opted for the larger GB and I'm so glad I did.... I have all my music, books, audio books, tons of games and even a handful of movies all in one speedy, beautiful, easy to use device!! I don't ever leave home without it! If you are a fan of the Tedeshi Trucks Band you will be very pleased with the growth of the bands sound and range. My father in law was still using his XP computer. with XP on its way out, i told him it was time to upgrade keep in mind my Father in law just turned 80 years young, so he needed something simple and reliable. this was the perfect solution! Great price for both a hard and digital copy of a great comic book film. Dark Souls 2 is more of the great and challenging gameplay that made the first Dark Souls game is wonderful. A game series unlike any I've ever played before. This product works great. It is plugged into my tower under the desk and the router is in a different room. Classic CD or DVD carrier case. A great Case Logic product that is basic and meets all expectations. Work great for me. Hp makes good ink. I would definitely recommend this product. Animated movie set to Beatles music that can be fun for the whole family. As long as they like The Beatles. If they aren't tape them down to the chair and make them watch this film. Restored and in 5.1 DTS Surround the color and sound is crisp even on DVD. You don't have to have this only on Blu-ray to enjoy it. Behind the scenes look is a nice bonus also. Work great for me. Hp makes good ink. I would definitely recommend this product. Big and very spacious refrigerator. Looks beautiful and very modern. Exactly as advertised. Awesome it works like its suppose to especially when I'm in the gym keeps me motivated listening to my music while I work out Very easy to install. Transfers information fast and hold a lot of information. I had to remove and re-insert the USB a couple of times, but it could be that particular port on my computer. Other than that, it's a great product and I recommend it. Great little headset that isn't expensive that can replace that cheap ear piece that comes with the ps4. I need something cause the other one wouldn't fit in my ear. I didn't want a headset that cost and arm and a leg either. Found this bought it and when i got home i tried it out and its so much better then the ear piece. If your looking to get a cheap headset i recommend it. Case is very high quality. I feel very confident case will protect my phone. I really enjoyed the LOTR movies and have been really looking forward to The Hobbit trilogy also. This is the 2nd film in the series and it doesn't disappoint. I liked the movie very much, but have been a bit disappointed that most of the Marvel movies come with a digital copy and some do not. I bought this to plug my iPod Nano into the amp on my Fork Bag Stereo on my Harley. I have an Audioquest HDMI cable and have been very happy with the brand. It is a bit pricey, but I definitely notice a higher quality sound coming from my fork bag stereo than it produced before with the cable it had shipped with. I purchased this product for a new PC in our vacation home. My tech friend who works for HP set it up for me - she says it great. I have a 2008 PC at home with Office Home &amp; Student 2007 which was installed with a disk - I find the 2007 version is still very useful. My friend said the 2013 version is even easier to install. I can hardly wait to use the new PC/Office 2013 in our vacation home.I may have to buy the 2013 inversion for my home PC! Always use this brand for this kind of product, as Sandisk is very reliable! I bought this to hold my iPod Nano and be able to attach it to my Fork Bag Stereo on my Harley. Easy to use, works as advertized, allows the iPod to be plugged in while still in the case. Disney has done it again! Great from start to end, had everything you would expect. Heart-warming moments, humor, great story telling with some twist &amp; a happy ending! Highly recommend for a family night! Purchased this movie for my mother, since she said it was one of her favorites. She was very excited and happy to receive this! Getting it from the bargain bin was a plus, as the price was just right! Because a lot of the footage was filmed in the 80's and 90's, most of it is not HD and is in 4:3 aspect ratio. That being said, I am very happy they finally came out with this Bluray. The Ultimate Warrior was my favorite wrestler when I was a kid and now that my son is in hiw teens and watches wrestling, I've been wanting to show him what it was like when I was growing up watching. Tom hanks is excellent as Walt Disney in this classic story telling of Mary Poppins. It's a different take on the story of one of the most beloved characters in Disney history. Not a film for children. Purchased this movie for my nephews, and they loved it! With this being in the bargain bin, the price was definitely worth it! I like to consider myself somewhat tech savy, so all these little gadgets and gizmos excite me. This one in particular has really been nice to pull out and use in front of people that did'nt think it would be easy to hurry and transfer data without a lot of work because of the connections that are available now a days. GoT is probably one of the best shows out there today. Looking forward to season 4. Came a across this movie while watching tv one afternoon &amp; was pleasantly surprised by how entertained I was by the actors &amp; the story telling. Well done telling of a tragic true story by everyone involved in the project.  Before this was available, I had been using my own adapter that I made. That worked well, but this offers a little better functionality. After the controller update, Xbox One also allows Dolby which sounds so much better now through my Astro A40's. Had to replace old hoses. New ones work perfectly with no leakage. I bought these speakers to have on my desktop to listen to music while working, and I am very happy with them. They were very inexpensive and while I could have spent more and got a set with bass speaker I didn't feel it was necessary for my application. I am very happy with my purchase and the price paid This set comes with Blue Ray and DVD formats, as well a digital copy for about $30. Awesome storyline with lots of twists. Good product that was quick and easy to set up. The picture is great. It was straight forward to install and get running, with no problems in the past 3 or 4 months of operation. Our internet connection is now maximized. This is a basic water filter and there really isn't much to say about it, other than it filters water. The phone is great for the price and the picture quality is fantastic. However you can't download but a couple of apps because it runs low on memory. You also can't store very many photos. That would be my only complaint. Great size great features long batter life. Very very happy with my purchase. Macs are so easy to use and so reliable. I love my mac. This game is the only reason I went with PS4 over Xbox One and it is well worth it. It has a great story and the abilities make you feel like a god. It's not as good as Rocksteady's efforts, but it's a nice game to fill that void until the next installment comes out. Also, it's the last one on current gen consoles. One of the funniest comedies on TV in recent years. Jerry Stiller, who was also in another comedy classic sitcom Seinfeld, is terrific in this as Arthur. The complete series is very funny and entertaining, has a high replay value. Set up is easy. Buttons are easy to see. Sound is great. Not sure if my installation issues were with the hard drive or my computer. I ended up having to follow some steps in an online video and erase data already on the hard drive before I could install it. I also had issues registering this product with their website initially not recognizing the serial number. But once I got it installed it has worked great! I would recomend this movie to everyone. Good story and great music score. My daughter has all the songs memoized. Great movie when we take our daughter and friends on road trip for a soccer game. Enjoyed getting entire family around tv for a great movie. This is a great cover for my iPad Mini. Protects the iPad and has pockets. Great movie, great price. What else can I say. I love the \"deal of the day\"! I loved the snapple peach tea in the bottle but now that I have a keurig I love making the peach tea with it and its less waste. Its so yummy! Great movie, great price, what else could i say. A+++ I have used many different routers and this is the best one that I have used. As more and more devices are connected, the router becomes more and more important. It just doesn't make sense to have multiple connected devices trying to all go through an inferior point of connection. I am currently using this router in a 4100 sqft house and it reaches to all places - the first router that I have owned that does this successfully. Also can stream video simultaneously to multiple devices including TVs and tablets. This router just works and is pretty straight forward to setup. I have been using it for a week so far and my experience has been excellent. If you need to cover a large area and you want excellent performance this router would be a good choice. It is not the cheapest one out there but I would rather spend more and get what I need which for me was extended coverage range and good throughput performance. This is a great tv. I would would buy another one. This item so far works great. Puts out a nice clean stream of air and it's very quiet. Plus there are no extra cost with buying replacement filters for it. It was easy to mount and it is very easy to maneuver. Also it is not as bulky as the previous one we had bought. Good sound quality and comfortable to hold. Haven't tested the range but no reception problems in the backyard or garage. very good story, funny,sad at the same time, Leo gave great performance, should have won Oscar. These headphones provide excellent sound quality, but are easily broken which I was told by friends before the purchase, therefore, I purchased the insurance and had them replaced only once since they were purchased almost 2 years ago. The game is fun hands down. The only frustrating part can be when you are chasing someone and your character decides to climb something rather than sprinting... I was looking for a relatively inexpensive Blu-Ray player for my parents. Consumer Reports gave this a good rating so i decided to give it a try. So far i am happy. i like this tablet very much. I use it to play games and read emails and such. I was looking for a relatively inexpensive HDMI cable and this fit the bill. I have used other Dynex cables in the past and although they aren't the fancy, high end cables they get the job done. I was debating whether to get a desktop PC or this All in One PC.\n",
        "I made the right decision, gone is the clutter that there would have been had I got the desktop. Still getting used to Window 8' great touchscreen\n",
        "which is very responsive. Beats audio is great sound from this machine.\n",
        "It is a little pricey, but the PC is built to last for me the next 10 years. I am pretty please with the purchase. The only issue I have had is I am running an audio optical cable through my Xbox1 (also running my FiOS through the Xbox1 as well). When the sound on the TV is on there is an echo. Obviously its the delay between the hmdi and audio optic cable. Even with the adjustment on the sound bar I cant get them to match up on live TV. There might be someone that has answer for that but I have not been able to find a solution to that just yet. Only problem was when i purchased my dishwasher, i did not know this did not come with it. When the delivery guys came to set up my gas range that i bought at the same time, they said they didnt install the dishwasher because there was another team that did that and i didnt have the installation package. If i would have known that, i would have purchased that when i bought the dishwasher. Frozen is great for the young at heart as well as kids. My wife has watched it at least 4 times since I brought it home. I thought it was a great animated movie also. Purchased this item to use with my PS3 Slim. The remote works great and I find it very useful when watching movies on the PS3. I purchased this game for my son. He enjoys playing this game which is based on the movie. PRETTY GOOD 3 D MOVIE. WOULD RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE IN 3D. Over all its a great game, cant wait to see what the next gran turismo gamr has un store Great quality on 3D as well as non-3D Movies.\n",
        "Allows 2 way communication between TV and components. I purchase this movie to test my 3D Samsung TV.\n",
        "The quality was excellent. I have not gotten my headphone wires ripped off of my ears or my phone ripped off of the headphones since using this product! Great Great Great for float trips! Brought this game for my three years old son and he love to play it. It has taught him a lot. Needed to replace my keyboard because it had no tilt. This product met that need and was an amazing price. I like otterbox but this is now the only case I will buy. It has saved my phone many, many times! I totally love the machine. Don't know if it's all the machine or different HE detergent but clothes seem cleaner. I thought my dryer was going out but now clothes are dried quickly. Love the controls on front of washer as easy for me to see and use. Would highly recommend machine for anyone. I use it only when playing online against other players. Really works well with other Sony equipment. Could use a \"cranky neighbor\" sound field! Overall it is an excellent product. Great crisp sound and fits in my ears well. The price seems a little high. Overall a pretty good shield. Better than others I've tried. If it were cheaper I would've bought full cover( front and back). I had been looking for a wireless printer for some time, and this model fits all my needs. It was up and running in less than 30 minutes, and has been working great ever since. I would highly recommend this item. Great fighting game. The storyline is pretty cool and keeps things interesting as you proceed through the game. There are plenty of side missions and online/offline battling modes to keep you from getting board. This was an awesome movie. It kept my attention the whole time. Usually I fall asleep during movies but not this one. The whole story was amazing! put television in spare bedroom for grandsons. great I originally purchased this movie for my daughter, but the entire family enjoys it! There's a good storyline with enjoyable characters throughout. We have also purchased the soundtrack and \"Let It Go\" deserved the award it won. Highly recommended to all! This item is a must have if you want to use your older turtle beach headset with the Xbox One. Foreigner best work at such a low price, cant' go wrong with that. I hope that in the future they have more classic rock sets like this one. Bottom line GREAT DEAL! Great gaming computer. Fast with great graphics on my 46in TV. Easy for beginners and colorful is strong, great resolution and details is meticulous, I love the game Got this refurbished for a great price and have not regret it at all. Wonderful machine for reading or just looking up information while watching TV. This is a first-party case from HTC, with the Product Name on the box listed as HTC HC C942 Hard Shell. It is translucent, as opposed to transparent, so on my Amber Gold M8 the color is definitely muted. It has HTC branding located directly over where HTC is on the back of the phone. The overall feel is good; exact match to the M8's curves with no seams that can be felt. It isn't slippery, but I wouldn't go so far as to call it soft touch. It also includes a screen protector, although I am not currently using it. It's nice to have a real first-party offering of this type of case and priced reasonably. This cord is great. It is heavy duty and is the right length. Delivery men installed it just right. Can't go wrong. This dryer is great. Matches the washer perfect. Energy efficient. Has all the cycles that I need. Runs quiet and does a very good job at drying. Can handle large loads. Matches the washer perfect. Purchased this product to connect my laptop to my tv and I've had no issues since using. I brought this headphone as a replacement for my son's previous pair. The original pair had broken on the headband area above the extension. Not a problem though. With the protection plan, it was easily replaced. No problems with the replacement set. All in all, my son and I love it. This washer is great. It is so quiet when running. Love all the features. Has large capacity. Shows how much time remaining for the wash cycle. Even plays a nice little song when the clothes are finished. Not a loud buzzer. Overall, great laptop. It has a sleek design and retina display is really nice. I like that the charger has a magnetic connection and this may minimize damage and wear to the cables. FYI, the macbook pro now does not have a CD/DVD ROM. Wish it had more USB ports, but that's not a major issue. Not bulky. Sometimes the mousepad could get a little out of hand, with all of the functions, but you get used to it. Overall, great laptop,but not necessarily worth how much it costs. The replacement Nunchuk Controller for Nintendo Wii works just as advertised. There may be others, but the original Nintendo still seems to be the best. Very nice camera , I just love the blue color of this camera, very chic!!and like always a great product of cannon. Very easy to use and fix everywhere, just a perfect size, great for travels and good memories. I recomend this camera! Webroot is a GREAT product! Since I have started using Webroot I have not had any viruses! If you have played any of the other Batman's by now, you understand what you are getting into. A great game with improved graphics, newer weaponry and abilities, but not altogether different, so there is a lot of familiarity. If you have not played the others, this will not seem so repetitive and the Batman franchise really has done well to create a series of games that keeps people coming back to them. Ready install and easy to use. Created virtually new machine due to increase in memory. happy with my purchase, does eveything I need it too, easy install, my only issue is a shorter power cord but that is my issue. easy to install, even for me. much cheapier alternative. I have been wanting to purchase a Macbook for a while, so after looking, I decided to go ahead and make the purchase. I will never go back to another brand computer! I absolutely love it. It is easy to use....I was like a kid in a candy store so I took a few hours to become familiar with it and ever since I have been in love. Purchased this to work with our photography station photography software and it does that well. Haven't used it much yet but so far we're happy with it. Although this is sold as a universal case, it was clearly made for the Nuvi 3597. The easy to operate magnetic clasp requires just one hand. Soft interior protects the screen. I would buy this again. It was a piece of cake to set up. I like that is compact in size. And it is easy to operate. Quality story, graphics and game play. An immense amount of content without add-ons. Terrific bargain for the buck. I always liked the way I could shout at my Android in Google Maps and get to where I was going. Now I can do it with the 3597. Voice recognition is dead on when the car is quiet. It will sometimes take more than 1 attempt when the radio is on or the windows are open or your annoying wife won't shut up. It boots up nearly instantly and if you haven't dramatically changed locations from when you shut it off, it finds satellites within a few seconds. The screen is awesome and plenty bright. I would buy it again. This is the best phone I have ever purchased!!! and I have bought alot of phones in the past.!!! I like the product but I would prefer a hard case. It does the job of holding my son's and father's Xbox games. We bought this and it was easy to use. We are using it with our 42\" TV in our bedroom. Product fits nicely in the ear but with the new style it keeps out a lot of the outside noise compared to the styles we were use to using. This Mickey Mouse Clubhouse DVD is great for toddlers. The characters are Disney and it has animals - a win - win! Just a funny movie. Such a great show got it and showed everyone I can wear these all day long and listen to music answer my phone calls. I have even fallen asleep watching movies and woken undisturbed. Its a nice stand but cost to much money. I would recommend it though. GREAT SOUND , BEST WOOFER I HAVE HAD, WHEN YOUR WATCHING TV OR A MOVIE IT JUST ROCKS I purchased the Harmony Ultimate One to replace my aging Harmony 1100. I like the one handed form factor of the Ultimate One, the ease of set up and use. One remote to control all of your home theater devices. The battery typically lasts me 2-3 days. For some reason I remember my Harmony 1100 lasting me a bit longer than that, but it is not a deal breaker. I just needed to train myself to remember to drop it on the charger more frequently. I chose the Ultimate One over the more expensive Harmony Ultimate because I do not have any of my devices hidden in cabinets that would require the IR blasters or the Harmony Hub. Beautifully shot series set in late 50's Miami. The Rat Pack era of booze, broads, cars and gambling. Worth it for the look of the show alone. Easy to set up except needed assistance to screw base on (easier when another helps hold the tv/base). Every one in the series continues to evolve! Love it! The upgrades to the controller was a nice touch. navigation on the user menu gives the user more control over the system, which is easier to use during or off gameplay. best gaming console hands down. This movie has great action and a wonderful cast!\n",
        "I am a huge Salam Hayak fan and she looks great! A great expansion that's still missing some things, Reaper of Souls gets Diablo right by fixing a lot of what was wrong with the Classic version.\n",
        "\n",
        "Auction House is out, Rifts and Bounties are in. Grouping and killing, getting Legandary items and changing your builds around them feels fun and rewarding, as opposed to the old way of just getting gold and searching for something on an ebay site in the game.\n",
        "\n",
        "Graphics and gameplay are fun and visceral. Sound design is SUPURB. Monsters sound NASTY and effects sound great. The Music is a step up from Classic, and they take some chances with odd choices that work really well. Voice acting is solid as usual.\n",
        "\n",
        "Act V is somewhat short, but really Diablo is not a game to judge by its story and length. The endgame has to be engaging and fun, and in the end we just want to plow through monsters and see that Orange flash as a Legendary drops.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bottom line - its fun, fast, and furious. Go kill some demons (and reapers) Got this primarily as a system backup when I re-format my internal drive. Setup was easy, as was updating drivers, etc. Worked great right out of the box. The battery life on this thing is great, I charge it about once a week. The tracking is accurate, and the ability to set alarms on it is great too. I'm really most satisfied with the sleep tracking. By tracking my sleep I've been able to pin point what I'm doing different that gets me great sleep. Great monitor, especially for the price. Considering getting another as a dual setup. This movie is great with all the stuff and whatnot.  This movie is great with the action and the stuff. I am very pleased with this phone. I waited for this phone for 6 months. I am not disappointed in any way! Thank you Samsung! I didn't think I was going to like this movie, but boy was I wrong. lol Perfect castings, plot, acting and lots of laughter. Is it worth buying, Oh yeahj!! The Deluxe Edition of R.E.M.'s second album includes a remastered album with an unreleased live concert from 1984. A must have for R.E.M. fans. Zagg's InvisibleShield is my first line of defense for screen protection! This is the original album JT recorded for the Beatles Apple label. Soon after, Apple let JT go and began a fruitful association with Warner Brothers Records. This album finally gets a proper release. I am glad to see the three Garza brothers were able to record another album after Henry almost lost his life two years ago. I hope there is more music to come. I do a lot of field surveys and the Griffin Survivor is great protection for my iPad while I am on the job. Great game. My son and I love it.. Especially head to head..\n",

        "Recommendation to any gamer This is the first of three Quincy Jones collaborations. I purchased this one day as the Deal of the Day for $3.99. You cannot go wrong for that. One sad note: the cd did not have the original reissue slip cover. I purchased the first Deluxe Edition of this album ten years ago. I purchased this only because it was $9.99 on sale. This is unheard of for a Universal Deluxe Edition release. I wished this release did not have the nine tracks redone by other artists. I felt more of Elton's live tracks should have been the extra cd as so many Deluxe Editions are. I bought this to use with my Panasonic Camcorder and works great. There are endless possibilities to the future of Chromecast. I enjoy not having to plug a HDMI cable into my laptop every time I want to watch something on a big screen. However, I run into wifi connectivity issues quite a bit that stops Chromecast from working. All of my other devices in the same general location never lose wifi, so it's a little frustrating. compatible with cell phone, expand my cell phone capacity. These headphones offer great sound with minimal background noise. AND they stay put in your ears! I love that I can put a whole apple, cucumber, etc. in it. This printer is really user friendly and easy to operate. I love the wireless function. I bought this along with my laptop. I use it all of the time. This new technology works as promised, solves a need tech consumers have been asking for, simple plug and play dongle connects wirelessly to broadcast computer screen to TV. Also has several apps that make broadcasting YouTube, Netflix and other programs seamlessly. Only drawback I have found is that secondary pop-up windows do not sync, remains on the main page. This does present problems on certain sites that use pop-up to stream videos. I was looking for a 29 inch monitor, but rather found this smart tv from vizio. Bought it and I'm using it as my desktop monitor. And it's cheaper &amp; better than having just a monitor since it's also a smart tv. I recommend this. Overall, the products is a great one for children, my kids are fond of it, and they get the best out of its apps. It a product to recommend to others. Love these headphones, good clear audio, strong but not overpowering bass response. So far they all recorded and i am 1/4 way through the spindle. Needed a fast and easy way for quick back-ups. This was the perfect item. THIS MUSIC BRINGS BACK MEMORIES OF YOUNGER YEARS. ITS THE RIGHT STUFF THAT SOOTHES MY SOLE AND BRINGS ME BACK TO MY YOUNGER YEARS! Great movie. If you don't laugh you fell asleep. One of the best of the year if not, THE best. For the price, can't beat performance. It won't turn any heads but it won't take away from your surround sound if used as a rear. THIS MUSIC BRINGS BACK MEMORIES OF YOUNGER YEARS. ITS THE RIGHT STUFF THAT SOOTHES MY SOLE AND BRINGS ME BACK TO MY YOUNGER YEARS! THIS MUSIC BRINGS BACK MEMORIES OF YOUNGER YEARS. ITS THE RIGHT STUFF THAT SOOTHES MY SOLE AND BRINGS ME BACK TO MY YOUNGER YEARS! My kids love this movie, can't get enough of it. Disney always gets the family together. THIS MUSIC BRINGS BACK MEMORIES OF YOUNGER YEARS. ITS THE RIGHT STUFF THAT SOOTHES MY SOLE AND BRINGS ME BACK TO MY YOUNGER YEARS! We'll from my point of view it's ok for someone that dosent understand. Much about tablets or computers,, Huge ensemble with some solid cameos. Consistently funny from beginning to end. I'm very pleased with this arm. We needed a TV to sit catty-corner in the corner of our breakfast room. the arm needed to be long enough to go our and come back in at the right angle for where we needed the TV. Great item. Very large capacity at a reasonable price. Was available when i needed more storage space for my HD video recorder. In my line of work, I need to listen to and make copies of CD's. I can do that with a minimal amount of effort. This is the second one of these I have purchased. I have one for another devise. Great product! I bought this novel clock/BT speaker for my desk for work. It draws compliments from all who see it. I use it mostly for the clock feature with the occasional music when I'm in the mood. I don't really care about the temp gauge. However I will check it for accuracy in the near future. Blue tooth pairing is seamless and automatic. Unlike the one reviewer, I found the volume to be plenty loud if desired. The sound quality is decent for the price I paid. It looks nice, but I don't think it's made from real wood. Not at this price, but it still looks really cool. I'm pretty sure the buttons are touch sensitive since you don't have to push very hard. Overall, I am very happy with the purchase and look forward to using it at the office. I can do everything I need and want to do on my new computer. It's easy to use, and I like that I do not have to worry about getting viruses. This is by far the best so far, Can hardly wait for the next season to come out. This is a great update. I have been a loyal Samsung used for years. Good cable for a fair price, like the shorter length. It works great, used both in home and at work, which is a classroom. Easy set up. With the advent of internet technology growth, I will be prepared. I bought these for my wife. she uses them everyday. I read the reviews before I purchased the product. The complaints about latency or lag time to send commends, latency or lag time when the phone is woken up to connect with the hub, and screen time outs are all FALSE. There are no latency / lag issues. Now I do happen to have a great wireless router so it probably helps to have a good one (e.g. apple). It's very easy to customize. I've been using a Harmony Ultimate One for about a year now and I like this product better. And the whole family can use the Harmony app on their phones to their liking. There is a bit of set up confusion out of the box so take your time if you already have a Harmony account and are adding this. Just pay attention and you'll be fine. I would like an enhancement to be able to add the \"favorites\" icon to new activities that I define that use my TV. Seems \"favorites\" is there for the default \"watch TV\" activity. If you create an additional \"watch TV\" activity, cannot get the favorites to show up. I'm certain that the enhancement will eventually make it into a future rev release of the software. Amust have for every marvel/dc/image/dark horse comic fan!!! Even if your not this is a great movie. Buy it now!!! I was very please with ease of use however no S-cable or VGA input. I love how it shows the CD jackets as songs are playing; but It takes too long to power up. It is a great battery, but I bought it so that I could use it with the new Sony POV camera that just came out. Im 95% sure that the camera is to blame for the overheating of this battery, because I have used several Sony cameras and camcorder and this is the first time i have a battery heat up to this degree. If would recommend this to any one who plans to take videos on day long activities. My son loves his Beats! He uses them every day with his phone or iPod. The insurance plan is great, the sound stopped in one ear, the headphones were replaced with no questions asked! We are happy customers!!! Let me just say I've been a Beyonce' fan since No, No, No (so I'm not a hater). I really like XO and Yonce'/Partition. However, I really wish I would have purchased the clean/edited version of this cd. Bey has always been unapologetically sexy, but the potty mouth is a bit much and def not \"safe for kids\". There is a mix and a bit of variety for everyone and I'll continue to listen to see if any of the other songs grow on me! :) i love that its so user friendly it tells you what part is going wrong when it has a problum I really needed something to replace an external hard drive I got 5 years ago. The fact that this one was powered through the USB port was a nice feature. The 2 TB size was a major upgrade from my 500 GB one. For a fast, easy back-up option, this product does the trick. There is nothing wrong with this iPod it runs smooth, has a taller screen, high resolution display, and runs on the smooth user friendly iPod/iPhone iOs7 which is easily navigable! Also the 16 gb capacity is just enough for the causal user. However it can be better. The most upsetting thing about it is the missing rear camera. It has a face-time camera but no rear camera. Also, the storage. The 16gb capacity is only fit for casual users unlike myself. If you are the kind of person that has tons of music and apps, I would highly recommend the 32gb version. It is not too much or too little. Though it is a bit more expensive, the 32gb comes with a rear camera and more space; This way you wont have to worry about downloading too many apps or music. I've only had it for a few days, but all I can say is \"wow.\" For one thing, I love how quiet it is. With six fans on full speed, it's so much quieter than the Asus it's replacing, and that one only had two. I love the design, the way you can open the fan coverings and keep it clean. So far the performance is top notch, and it's great that you get the actual discs #how long has it been since I've seen one of those come with a computer?# with the operating system and all the drivers for the various components. You also get the paper work for each component. I didn't even have to download any Windows updates! That is a first for me. No junk programs, either. I had a couple of questions, and the customer service agents were superb: Fast, friendly, knowledgeable. If I have to be nit picky, there's no wireless internet connection, but my adapter works great. I don't plan on using this one online, anyway, other than for program installation and updates. And on the outside casing, the red on the front panels appears to be painted over the black, but really, it's well done and pretty. I didn't buy it for the looks, I bought it for the specs. It does everything I need it to do. I mainly use it for writing, Photoshop and video editing. I'm also a musician and will possibly install Ableton 8 and Amplitube for recording. If I do that, there's plenty of room for expansion and a new soundcard with the proper inputs. I have no reason to believe that there won't be enough power. If I was less busy, I'm sure I'd get back into gaming. Oh, and on a side note, it was even packed better than any computer I've ever seen. One little port had a rubber stopper in it that had fallen inside...I was planning to open the case, anyway, to make sure all wires were connected, and they were. I guess you could say I'm extremely happy with this purchase. It meets my needs, and I hope it has longevity. So glad I could get a pc of this quality with Windows 7. Chicago is a great movie. The acting is top notch they all deserved getting Oscars. Another lovely design. Compact. Fast and versatile. Wonderful design, ergo friendly, Wireless....great for my arthritic hand. WOW IM IN PRESSED WITH THE PS4 CONSOLE AND GRAPHICS WISE WAS WELL WORTH THE MONEY Love the wireless keyboard. Apple takes the frustration and confusion out of the computer world. No conflicts...no hassles, Music by the pool - - need I say more. Love Sonos and the way it connects to my devices. Makes listening to music a pleasure. Functional high capacity card. No problems with it so far. I went with this over the other brand because of the price difference. The packaging was also labeled to answer all my questions while it was necessary for me to research the basics on the competitor. Great Buy until I can afford the SSD swaps. Super lightweight and easy to use and sets up in minutes.\n",
        "A little pricey but worth it in comparison to other tablets. Very good build quality. More than adequate selection of features. Dries well although most programs seem to take 45-50. so far so good.\n",

        "It fit in my Droid phone and the capacity has alowed me to keep all of my photos (so far).\n",

        "The speed has been great, much better than my old card. Jason Statham is one of my favorite actors, he does great action packed movies. The acting is good, their are a couple of scenes that are drawn out and not needed to tell the story. This is a great tea for someone looking for more of a \"tea\" taste than the Snapple products. This may be the favorite k-cup in my house. It was the most popular during Easter and I'm already on my second box. Flavor is good - overall no complaints. I just expected a richer chocolate taste. Maybe its just too dark for my taste in hot cocoa. Easy to install. Thin case with great protection. Exactly what I was looking for. Chai is one of my favorite types of hot beverages. The Chai Latte has a smooth flavor with just the right amount of spice. Great storage system. Only problem has been the amount of counter space. I placed the unit in a corner where my flour and sugar canisters used to be and I originally placed the canisters on top of the storage unit. Unfortunately, the unit began bend under the weight. We love the brewer in our house. It is so convenient to be able to make single cups as we all have different taste in beverages. I am impressed by the variety of beverages offered but at the same time really appreciate the fact I can use the brewer to dispense hot water and continue to use my old favorites. Overall I owuld say this is a very good printer. I like that it is easy to use and you can print, fax, and copy all for a great price. The printer is easy to set up. I like that you have the option to use this printer wireless or wired. However printer is a little slow when printing I bought this as a secondary battery for my Canon T5i. Works as expected. This Otterbox is a much They are definitely working to improve their products. I have gotten some dust and pet hair under the acrylic screen protector which has been difficult to remove. A role that Christian has never done before. Talk about being in control, but he took care of everything in a calm manner. I don't want to give it out, but no one messes with his family and gets away with it. :) android's equal to iphone imho . good camera. phone calls sound like listening to someone underwater. my first smartphone, so the learning curve is steep --this phone easy to learn on. It's great for listening to mp3 audio books. Has auto shut off if left In pause for a long time. An all around great album by the band. A fantastic followup to their last work, and a solid addition to their discography. Salesperson helped me locate item with best capacity that fit my needs. I've been pleased with it's performance in my android tablet. Pictures are great and free apps are as clear as those paid for. The keyboard has a lot of missed strokes with characters at the ends of the rows. Siri is more than frustrating. This is a light comedy with some hilarious situations good for a quiet evening where you want something entertaining and funny without having to work too hard watching the movie. This particular pack of paper has good brightness and smooth surface and works good in my ink jet HD printer producing good quality printed images. a great addition to the discography. I definitely recommend. good move a little slow at times but the story is good Love the way this looks...nervous about the durability of the case &amp; how well it will protect my phone. My keyboard on my home office computer had some major sticky keys and it was beginning to not function at all sometimes. I had been wanting a wireless mouse for it after previously purchasing a Logitech one for my laptop. The keyboard going bad was the final straw and I hopped online to look for a new one. I stumbled upon this set and it was on sale at the time. When it arrived in the mail, I quickly took it into the office and out of the box. The directions were so simple to follow and I had both the keyboard and mouse working in under 5 minutes. I have been using both for a couple of months and I love the freedom from cords that this wireless combination brings. I also love the rubberized grip on each side of the mouse. My only issue is that I often forget to turn off the on/off switch when I'm done using them. I wish it had a beep or other noise it would make to remind me to turn it off when the computer powers down. I now own a total of 3 wireless Logitech products and am very happy with all of them! I read the book this movie was based on years ago and stumbled on the DVD. The DVD was very true to the book and is a gripping true tale. Seeing these people's struggle and will to survive fit with my images from the book. If you are looking for a action thriller without much violence or bloodshed, this film is for you. Except for the issues taking photos, I love my new phone. I like that you can talk through the flip case. Great game to play, especially with friends. Buy it now!!! Switched from an android... Keyboard is easier to use to text on the iPhone...wish the screen were a bit bigger Love it so far. Gets the clothes clean, easy to operate, and uses less water. fast action move good plot a lot of fight's to add to the action For $3.99 (marked $7.99, but rang up discounted), I couldn't pass up a collection of Jimi Hendrix classics! good tv for the price, easy set up. this is my second Samsung and I am very happy with their products USH-1 CLASS 10 digital card permits extraordinary high speed for transmitting digital images to the digital memory card enabling shorter times between capturing images. I enjoy these headphones fully! The comfort of the studio wireless beats and the ability to pair and use away from my phone, computer, and tablet makes them very useful! I use them for music mixing, exercising, while cutting grass, or just relaxing. Easy to pair! Only (something like a) complaint I have is the \"noise cancelling (or reduction)\". They don't quite do as advertised. But overall, I enjoy them!  For $7.99, I couldn't pass up a collection of Lynyrd Skynyrd classics! Original charger stopped working. Replacement worked great and was on sale. Easy to use and can change to use for different models. Lived up to my expectations! Out of the box, the instructions were easy to follow and the set-up was simple. Bottom line...it made an old PC work like a new WiFi enabled PC! The battery life is great for the price. I will also use these batteries. This is the greatest thing ever. Don;t worry about losing the receiver, because ti stores right inside the bottom of the mouse! Brilliant! Great story, great action, great plot. Liam Neeson.... I got this jump drive to back up my pictures and stuff from my computer just in case it crashes. It is small so I can store it easily, not flashy and works great. Now, when it comes to center speakers, I may not have too much knowledge. But all I know is that this was perfect for the price. I bought this for my home theater living room that's 13x14 and it fills up the room perfectly. Bigger areas... You may need to do more research but I think these will be perfect. This is the 3rd printer I've purchased in the last 2 years. It replaced an HP printer and I don't think I'll ever go back. Faster printing, cheaper ink, and so far, far fewer (zero) problems.\n",

        "You won't regret this model. I bought 2 tower Klipsch speakers and needed a sub and the guy who works in that area talked me into buying this over a Klipsch sub that cost about $200 more. When he compared them both, you couldn't tell which one was which. I'm very please with this sub, really happy watching action movies with it!! Touch screen works great with the windows 8 menu. Not sure how I feel about windows 8 though, will be hard to adjust from the older version. Wow, this was a great deal I was talked into. I planned on getting these speakers from inside the magnolia section. But this guy was there with me said save your money and get these Klipsch speakers. He's some guy who goes to a local campus and he said they're amazing. I tested them and fell in love. Saved about $400 on getting these. Perfect for me because I have a 13x14 living room so the sounds fills it up! You'll be so happy with these, I tested Man of Steel with these and it was incredible. Worth every penny. a great middle of the road router. gets the signal out to about 50 feet away Recently acquired this phone to replace my S3. Overall I'm really happy with this phone especially with the discounts and gift card offers. I do recommend. I just hope 18 months from now the battery is still holding on strong. For small ears the size is perfect and stays in your ears, sounds is Crystal clear, and priced just right Great earbuds for the price....needed something inexpensive for the gym and these work well. They look good, fit well, and sound as food as any other earbuds in their price range. I expected more of a JA type movie, not a movie trying to follow a plot line. there are parts of the movie that are very funny, but tying it to a plot line leaves you wondering what the point really is. I watched this movie as a kid and I still enjoy it today. A real coming-of-age story. Great cast and great soundtrack. Voice narration by Richard Dreyfus is superb. One of my all-time favorite movies. The cast is unmatched. So sad that Harold Ramis is not here anymore to complete the series. An all-American classic movie that should not be missed by young or old. Good refresh rate, overall good picture and without a sound bar, it still has pretty good quality of sound. Good internet connectivity. This is a nicely featured toaster and easy to use for lots of different bread types. It is easy to use and has a variety of settings which are easily chosen and indicated. It appears that the heating elements heat unevenly resulting in unevenly toasted results. For the price, I expected better. Believe it, wireless headphones that sound as good or better than even some pricey headphones. Sold on Sol Republic; great product, great price. Love this router so much. Had a linsys blue router which was on its last leg. I saw this router at a great price and had great reviews. It has great range and fast speed. The software that comes with it is also great. You can even check it on your iphone or android phone, def a plus. Def a great buy and router! Great sound quality and battery life for such a small device. Would recommend to anyone. Good price for the capacity; fast enough to get the job done. I've used wireless mice in the past and always stressed about how fast they went through batteries. This notebook style mouse had good reviews and I find it works well with my laptop for school work. Liked the sequel a lot answered some questions left open but the end makes it hard to imagine there being anymore Diablo games Got a great deal on an open box; needed a new keyboard and picked it up. To truly enjoy gaming, you have to have a controller that works with you not against you. I was gaming without one and then finally got this for my birthday. It is a good general purpose controller and I'm happy with it Gives your kids the ability to buy content with out using your debit or credit cards. Makes a great gift. Other than support for HBO Go and other premium network services, it's a great box. Love the optical outlet and pass through support I got this as a gift and it's really become a standard accessory walking out the door. I play music from it in the truck, I can show a friend a train video clip, listen to FM radio anywhere. Just a handy little device! Kids love to play thsi game but have a really hard time trying to get it to two players. As I am typing this from them, I am not even sure it is a multi player game, but I had thought it was when I purchased it. Kids say it has lots of neat features. I was really excited to use this vacuum as I had never spent this much on a vacuum before and had read lots of good reviews. Upon opening the box, and taking apart everything I found that the instruction manual was missing, maybe I received a vacuum that was returned :(\n",
        "\n",
        "Pros: CORDLESS, Easy to set-up, Lightweight (1/3 of weight of my Bissell Powerforce upright), LED lights were so bright that I didn't even have to turn lights on in a dark room, looks great, does't take up much space, the clear casing makes it easy to see if something is stuck in the brushes, worked well on tile, brush head is low profile so I was able to get under couch and furniture easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cons: Doesn't pick up as much as my broken Bissell Power Force (that was 1/3 of the price) on carpet, emptying was easy but had to pull out hair by hand, it has a pretty loud high pitch sound when on (I always vacuum around my toddler and it doesn't bother her, however this one made her cry)\n",
        "\n",
        "Bottom Line: There are some great features on the Hoover Air Series 3.0, but I'm looking for a do-it-all vacuum (esp when I spend $300) that has great suction on carpet, this one is more for hard floors. This is a great starter tablet. not a ton of bells and whistles but great screen quality and speed. What isn't great about the Simpsons? Great picture and sound quality. Hard to imagine a better mid range priced speaker. I can tune in to a Paris radio station with the quality of a source 20 miles away...Will be adding at least one more shortly. Kids say if you fall in the water and the fish eats you that the character looks sad and that makes them sad. Otherwise they talk and talk and talk about how great the game is and how fun it is to get to the new levels. What isn't great about the Simpsons? Great picture and sound quality. This will be my sons review as I bought the game for him. he is 14. Love the on line gaming. Very challenging. didn't think the campaign was great and the gun selection was a little lacking. But overall it was worth the money and many hours have been spent playing it. My kids talk forever about this one. Challenging for them and they have a blast. :) I am very happy with the phone. Its larger screen, faster processing speed, improved graphics &amp; picture quality make it worth the $ to me. needed to replace old ps3 controller - got this on sale - usual great quality from sony. Great value. Love this movie. I always get the digital copy. Cable is used to connect to control panels for communication transmissions. Very reliable and quick connections are obtained. This laptop backpack is a bit larger than Synergy laptop backpack. I have to return this one because the side zip and mesh pockets are a bit too shallow and narrow. Also, it does not have a front pocket compared to Synergy. This cartridge is easy to install and has great color quality. Cute story. Great gameplay that also involves some challenge. I am really glad my daughter recommended that I get this. The ZaggKeys Folio case allows me to protect my iPad and maximize the ease of using it by having a physical keyboard. The case covers both the back of the tablet and the screen when the case is closed. The keyboard is backlit; there are seven color options for the keyboard light. I use the keyboard every day; I've only had to charge it once in the two and a half months I've had it. This case is almost as heavy as the iPad Air itself, but since both items are so light, I don't really notice. They keys are spaced out nicely and it's nice to have a set of shortcut keys in the top row. This is a great accessory for my tablet! The two people who came to setup my home theater were great. They asked where I wanted items places, were courteous and explained everything when they were done. They did an excellent job of cleaning up after the were done with the install. I would highly recommend these two for other jobs. I purchased these Apple earbuds when Apple originally released them with the iPhone 5 in 2012. I love them! In fact, I purchased extra earbuds for my travel bag, brief case and backpack so I will never leave home without them.\n",
        "\n",
        "I enjoy listening to music or talking on the phone with my earbuds since it includes a microphone. I can adjust the volume, control music and video playback, etc., with the control capsule. The Apple quality you receive for the price is well-worth it. I bought this bag almost 5 months ago when I purchased a new 13 inch MacBook Pro. The laptop fits great, although if I carry the power cord, it makes the bag look bulky. Overall durable and professional. It can easily work for a man or a woman. Provides great organization as well. This HDMI was easy to install and its length was right for my Samsung Blue Ray.. Its great for the Note 3, instead of the otterbox making it even larger and bulkier then it already is, the Platinum is nice, secure and keeps its shape. I love this Samsung blue ray as the use of it and the functions are easy. I love the picture quality along with my Samsung TV Its a OK box For Streaming, Has a lot of Channels, and Some games, not bad for the money! Great wireless speaker. Incredible sound for its size. Doesn't take up much space. I have it in a bathroom, have another one as a \"portable\" unit that I move from room to room as needed.\n",

        "Sonos is not cheap, but gives you great sound with flexible and easy access to your music. one can only let the CD speak \"great\" for itself !! This is my 4th OtterBox purchase for Apple products. 1st for iPhone 5c, others are different products. The OtterBox is my choice for cell phone and iPad protection due to the sturdiness of the product and easy installation. It is very efficient, and really quiet. It does seen to run a long time but cleans great. I am quite happy with it. works as described which is all one can ask..good! the best is the best title for S&amp;G. Their music is timeless. I would watch this over again and again. It a great movie!! journey is and has been one of the best classic rock bands ever..this live performance is more proof I think it is a must see, very funny but no suprise at the end. Case is easily put on phone and protects very well including from liquids. My daughter had to have the best protection, but it came with a high price--worth it if it protects her phone from any damage. Easy to install and set up. Works well provides clear picture. Needed something to go from box to TV after hanging on wall was perfect They are good batteries from a good company. Not much else to say. Son loves it so I'm happy. Loves the songs and all the singing. I needed a longer hdmi cable than what I had on hand, so I ordered this cable. Transports the 1's and 0's to &amp; from my receiver like it should. Good phone as a corded landline phone when the power goes out in your location. Great sound and very easy to setup. Set up the remote to do all of my devices. I waited about 3 days to get my hands on a pair and believe me the wait was well worth it. I had been debating whether to go with AKG but after listening to these there was absolutely no contest. Money will spent. I feel it should have come with a better case though. I love skullcandy after buying my first over the ears headphones. So when my old pair was damaged, I turned back to them for replacement. I write, and often use the headphones to allow me to cancel the noise of others and be able to concentrate on writing. These allowed me to increase the bass, which is a huge thing to me, and thought I have beats audio I still enjoy some songs with the extra bass and love being able to adjust it as I need. The writing is sharp. The voice acting is sharp. The animation is sharp (in a retro-modern way). I really can't say more that probably hasn't already been said... Highly recommended! Must see to keep up with all the plot lines threaded through out all the Marvel movies. Overall, a pretty good game. I have not got to play much, but it's pretty good. Excellent graphics. Make sure your computer can handle it. I bought the DVD version, not the download version. Came with 3 DVD's and took awhile to fully install on my PC. Many of the servers are playing the newer maps, and to get those, you'll also need to buy the \"premium\" version also for another $49.99 Nothing earth-shattering, but does what it is supposed to do. Got this for training and running a mini-marathon and it has worked fine for me. This is first rear view camera I have purchased. It has been very beneficial to me. This game was really fun to play, especially the online multiplayer. For this price this is a very good headset...it can be comparable to high end sets... Best movie of 2014 easily. \"Let it Go\" sequence is simply amazing. My printer won't operate without all the necessary colors so I had to buy it! Overall a great product and great value for the money! It really helps when interviewing people and getting that sound bite. I'm very impressed with the advances made over the original Galaxy Gear. All of the overall functions have been improved. The camera and microphone locations are much better. I was talking to someone with it and they could not even tell! The speaker however should be at the bottom of the face of the watch. It would be easier to hear, although it does sound good and clear in a quiet room. I was really impressed when I was able to do a Google search using the microphone of the Gear 2, way cool! I'm very glad I made this purchase. It is fantastic! Great phone case. Waterproof and protects phone from damage from a fall. Would def recommend! This card was convenient to purchase because I needed $50 worth of PSN bucks. I had 2 computers that crashed at the same time. So I upgraded both of them at the same time. One was a HP and the other was a Toshiba. The hard drives work fine with both. I would recommend this hard drive. A pretty nice but pricey backpack. It has many pockets. The problem is a pretty small compartment to put additional stuff when travel. Watch out of the rubber-like bottom of the backpack. It could get \"scratched\" easily. I had to use glue to glue back the \"scratch\" back. The thin bezel and clean picture make this a great TV for a 2nd room. We are only using it for watching TV, no blue ray connected to it, so the 720 P resolution is more than enough for what the cable company sends us (usually 480!). Very good sound and the picture is find in dark or when the sun lights up the room. I had to replace the hard drive, so I figured that I would also upgrade the ram, It was very easy to set up. Once I placed the hard drive into my granddaughters computer and ran the programs to set up her computer, of which the original hard drive went out, I had no problems. I have used this same hard drive for other computers that have crashed. Another great gem from nintendo. If you own a 3ds, this game is a must. Its very similiar to the sims, more or less. Juicer takes a whole apple without peeling or coring it. Having two speeds makes it easy to adjust the vegetables and fruits that I use with my recipes. It is easy to clean with cleaning utensil provided and compact enough to leave out on the counter. First let me say you will need some level of technical ability, and time to tinker around with settings to get everything (mostly) set up the way you want. My main issue, was having trouble accessing recorded footage. With some help from the internet I was able to locate a number for Dlink (877-453-5465).\n",
        "\n",
        "I have little to no expectations when calling a company for technical support. So I was shocked to find the agent (Employee # AR004642) extremely helpful, knowledgeable and was able to solve my issue by remoting into my pc and showing me how to change java's settings to allow access to the ip address of the DNR-202L.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unless I'm missing something, one issue Dlink can hopeful find a resolution for is the ability to simultaneously have record on motion detection AND email alerts (pictures) with the ability to enable/disable email alerts. If you have both on you will get never ending alerts. If you turn it off you no longer get recording on motion detection. The only other option I see is leave recording on 100% of the time, which is pointless. We bought 2 Jawbone Up24s to track our daily steps - one for me and one for my spouse. We created a team of about 5 people and we are able to see how active each person is every day. It has been a fun competition to make all of us move 10,000 steps each day. The Jawbone was easy to set up and we use the app on our iPhones to view our daily progress. We have had our Jawbones for almost 30 days and have had no issues. We charge the band about once a week. We highly recommend the Up24. I absolutely think it is a marvelous DVD player. I like SONY products anyway. But the fact that my dad is pleased; is what it is all about. Overall I would recomend this to any Mobile DJ Service that uses a laptop and needs to download music really fast &amp; is easy to use Love the colors, fits IPhone well, I plan on purchasing the other two colors!  When I switched over to a Solid State Drive for my boot device on my computer, I was originally going to use my original HDD as internal storage. However, after wiping it, the device no longer wanted to initialize, so I needed a replacement HDD.\n",
        "\n",
        "I'm sure this HDD works fine as a boot device, but I find it even better as internal storage. Installing it wasn't a problem, so long as the user knows how to set the boot order correctly. The device initialized and formatted easily, giving me plenty of storage to work with. Why spend 3X-5X for cables unless you're working with high-end video components/monitors. Couldn't tell a difference between this cable and one that was twice the price and this one was two feet longer. I like the story &amp; cinematography, keeps you glued to the TV. It's a good product overall. It's overpriced, but that is most Apple products. Things just get better and better with this series. The ending was surprising. I was looking for a replacement for a Klipsch Home Theatre System. After reading several reviews and researching, I chose the Denon. My wife and I have been very happy with the overall performance of the sound bar. It's very easy to set up. The Bluetooth works well with the IPhone. Overall, very satisfied with the product. I am happy so far with this computer. It was easy to set up and get started. Nice clear screen. This movie put the 1st 3 movies with Toby Mcguire to shame! Spiderman is portrayed so much more accurately and the overall production of this film blew the others out of the water. Great product. So easy to use straight out of the box. It was a good price for the size of the drive. A very action packed movie with great acting and excellent character portrayal by the actors! Item complies with statements printed on their marketing materials, box etc. Compact, light and durable. This movie was really good! The plot has tons of twists and is a nice change from the over killed paranormal/possession horror films that seem to be everywhere. If you like other BBC offerings like Planet Earth and Frozen Planet, you will very much enjoy this movie. The 3D version adds some real interest. There are camera angles where you seem to be flying right next to birds. Other camera views show enormous flocks of birds where you can see immense depth and feel part of the action.\n",
        "\n",
        "A great movie and great in 3D. The only drawback is my family enjoys hearing David Attenborough as the narrator. Unfortunately, he does not voice-over this movie.\n",
        "\n",
        "Still a valuable addition to our DVD Library. The story mode in the game is very interesting. It is the beginning to all the games, I think. It's very fun. I had great experience with mophies, however this particular version keeps owing me battery life.\n",
        "\n",
        "I have another mophie red for iphone 4 and I can fully charge my iphone 4.\n",
        "I was under the impression that this version will do the same, and it does not last as its previous model, I do even close all apps, and set to airplane mode to avoid any background data, but still it doesn't charge more than 78% This device is far better from previous models I had, the picture quality and the display its really good. I liked the Slow Motion Video Feature and the fingerprint access. The phone overall is great. The battery lasts along time. I use my phone as a hotspot at work, which is pretty much on while i'm at work. Still the battery lasts over 24 hrs. I also like that you can turn-off apps that come preinstalled so you don't have to worry about them running in the background. I agree with some of the previous reviews about the speaker phone cracking. It would be nice to have the HTC speakers on this phone. The Tales series is one of the hallmark JRPG series of the last gaming generation. Tales of Vesperia is one of the best entries in the Tales series with gorgeous graphics, a great battle system, and a great story. If you have an opportunity to play this I would definitely recommend this game!!! Bought on sale and because it has multiple Zones. I wanted to be able to play music outside and this will hopefully work. I have only tested primary 5.1 inside until the weather warms up. Happy with qualities I have tested to date. It has airplay and works well with my iphone. Have it connected to the home network directly to use the iphone app. Very pleased with the purchase so far and would recommend to others. One of the hottest rappers in the game right now. Alot of solid tracks on this album. would have been nice if this actually came with the bonus disc of live material like it says in the product info, but it does not. great album otherwise! Despite the bugs that have plagued the game for some when it is up and running it is a console multiplayer experience like no other. The game is beautiful and the gameplay is very smooth even with the huge maps and mass numbers of players. DICE has continued to fix the bugs as time has passed and further DLC will only make the game better. Alot of catchy beats and solid lyrics. Definitely a solid album. Bough this for my mom to get netflix/hulu etc. Required an hour to set up but then seems maintenance-free. This game is basically just pure fun, the story isn't great nor very long but it is a fun game. If you are looking for a good TV for a great price, this is a great choice. Gives great sound for movies or music. But too tall to sit in front of tv unless you have an adjustable height stand. Worth buying the new tv stand though. No wires come with it either. A little different. Only two actors, Clooney and Bullock, but it was good. This game is another excellent addition to the Assassin's Creed series, some may find it repetitive or not like the yearly release, but in no way has the quality of the game dropped of from previous entries. had a boston acoustics that gave me problems so I replaced it with the POLK bar. Glad I did. At first i was picking at some of the things they changed in the storyline but after watching the whole movie i had to say i enjoyed it flaws and all. There were great special effects,great fight scenes,and the acting was pretty good. Zack Snyder did good hopefully the sequel can improve on the first outing... i was skeptical at first, not computer savy at all...but setting up my i-pad with my interests was very easy...i play alot of word games and hidden object games to keep my mind sharp and i do research and it has benefitted me. i highly recommend it... This is a pretty good game, it is worth playing at the least for the fifth level that takes place in an asylum. It had a good atmosphere, graphics and gameplay. It was a little more linear than I had expected but an overall solid game. okay this was great are the package there was an RFI filter that you have to put on no problem just snap it on on the porch shows how to do it in the instructions. Then you plug it into your galaxy device and there is a little a micro USB port on the side of the unit that you plug your your charger into. So while you're watching the movie your Galaxy is under AC power you do not have to watch it just off of the battery.as I stated above their work apps in the audio of about 2 seconds each and if there were about for gaps in a movie. A full length movie.that could have been my machine running too many apps in the background I'll check in and put comments back on this when I verify that. Other than that great piece of equipment a little expensive but worth it. I really like the cover. A little bulky to slip in your pants pocket. I love listening to my music loud and this sub sounds great with my klipsch speakers. Love this movie and so do the people i recommended it to. Its about a friendship that develops between a boy and a robot from outer space. The boy tries to protect him from government agent fearing it might be dangerous to the country. paper is good, even for printing photos that I might like to preview b/4 putting on photo paper or card stock, doesn't smear easily very good price had a gift certificate to lower the price I bought the cd because i liked the spanish tracks but listening to the entire cd there were also some catchy tunes i liked. A solid album overall. i enjoy watching the movie. i love sandra bullock. i added this this movie too my over 1500 movies i have Very stylish and the laptop fits great inside. I picked it online and did the store pickup. Very convenient. Features on this mircowave are better than our old one. The wife was not happy about the controls at first until she discovered how easy everything was to operate on this unit. Best mircowave I have ever had so far. Thanks Bought some for my sons learning tablet and was surprised it lasted the whole weekend! My son is on his tablet all day. Good for 3-4 days of continuous use. I bought the Naga Hex for The Elder Scrolls Online the day it came out. My previous mouse would not keep up with me and only had three buttons. The six buttons on the side are very easy to use and i got use to them (memorizing which key was where and not clicking any by mistake) in a day or two. The Naga Hex is incredibly responsive with both movement and clicking speed. The design is really comfortable and looks very nice. The only drawback i have found is it is a little thin to fit the average size hand. The black curve on the right side fits my third finger perfectly but then it just drops off and my pinky is left hanging. Other then that i would certainly recommend the Naga Hex to and PC/Mac gamer! The movie is definitely worth viewing. There was a lot of hype about this movie. It is a quality offering, The main point that adds interest is the viewer. You imagine your emotions and thoughts if were you in similar situations. The movie is worth owning, but I would not spring for the 3D version. It really only seemed to add some depth to the images. There was not too much extra offered by 3D. good flash drive. i just store files on it. it just a flash drive Great value, right size. Would definitely recommend. This is my second Cabrio washer that I have owned and i'm amazed at how clean this washer gets your clothes. I was skeptical at first with such a small rotating beater bar but was pleasantly surprised with the results. Yes ladies guy's can do wash too! Stand has been great. The suction cups were a little hard to install. I love the height adjustments available. Also being able to turn the t.v. with ease is really nice. Wonderful CD of the original Broadway cast recording. It's fun to listen to the clever lyrics that I missed during the live show because some songs were sung so fast and other times the audience was laughing. I love this system and it has brought a smile to my face every time i use it. it has great sound quality and will shock you with its performance must have for anyone looking for a good computer sound system. Another animated series based on the movie. A great show. Very easy to install. Happy with the print quality. I was concerned about them drying out as I don't print very often but I have not noticed any signs of that up to this point. not much to report on a game. no scratches and it works as expected This is basically a nice head-phone radio. The sound and range are good. When used for a telephone conversation over my iPhone, the sound is good at both ends. Not so nice: The controls are difficult to use unless looking at the unit, which requires removing it from your head. I use it with both an iPhone and an iPad and have trouble switching it from one to the other. It is not comfortable when lying down -- I wish the back strap were adjustable. As it is, it knocks the earphones off my ears if I rest my head back on it. I've trying to buy movies in all three formats: DVD, bluray and digital copy, and this version fit the bill. Not to mention, that it's a great movie for kids and adults. I was in 9th grade I think when this album came out and I was just learning who Led Zeppelin was. From my perspective, this was the first new Led Zeppelin music that I had ever heard -- everything else was well established. I remember hearing their hardcore fans complain about them \"mellowing out\". And I remember a DJ on the radio defending their need to expand into different musical styles and their right to mellow out if they wanted to. But good music is good music no matter what. The songs sounded great to me, especially \"In the Evening\" and \"Carouselambra\"; songs that seem influenced by Kashmir which I absolutely loved and still do to this day. I also think those songs were the template for much of Robert Plant's solo material. Anywho, if you're reading this you already like this album and want to buy it (probably re-buy it). When it first came out it had a brown paper cover. I never really figured out why since there is nothing risque about the actual cover. This is the first printer I have purchased in years. It was easy to setup. I can print from my phone or laptop with no issues. I don't use it frequently but have not encountered any problems in the few months I have owned it. Nothing possitive or negative. This is just a memory card. The price is right, and the sound is bang on the money has f function keys, very important, and is easy to use Battery life seems to have shorten after a few weeks. Good overall, needs a mouse.\n",
        "Font size is too small. I bought it because the salesperson suggested it and I am satisfied with this product. My 6 year old loves her Kindle. She is able to use it without much help at all. I can still lock it down if necessary. Overall good for the money! it was a movie in a series that everyone is familiar with, which makes it enjoyable. This is the best cable modem modem to date. If you have twc, comcast, and other cable isps, get this modem, so u dont have to pay their rental fee. good product, but expensive for the amount you receivd I package. Despite its two- and a half-hour length, it flies by and just like a great dream you don't want to wake up from, even after the end credits start, you'll desperately crave five more minutes. good movies, for adult and kids to enjoy together. What more can I say I love this game works so well now onto buying more songs I always drop my phone so I figured I better get a good case for my Ipad &amp; do not regret it as I have already dropped this &amp; everything was fine Haven't got in to much of it but game looks good and somewhat like the last one We were looking for a wireless system but did not find a lot of options. We wanted all speakers to be wireless and not just the subwoofer like most systems. We thought this unit was a bit pricey (still do) but decided to take a chance. The sound quality is great. The soundbar looks like most other soundbars but the quality appears to be above average. We are happy with the purchase. The phone app is cool enough to impress my teenage kids so that is a big plus. You can control volume and play your phones playlist through the app. I am thinking of buying another pair so that I can stream the same music throughout the house. Setup was pretty easy. I would have rated this item 5 stars but for the price. Very useful if you cannot buy directly on playstation I'm using to get rocksmith songs! Picture is great, sound leaves a little more to wish for. It is a great unit, but if you want to be 100% satisfied, you may want to upgrade it with a sound bar.\n",
        "GoPro videos look fantastic on this set! I was not sure if I would get the new air or this one &amp; chose this because of the price, I am very happy with it. I had the original Ipad so it was really slow &amp; would shut down when I tried to do too much, this one is so fast I can't believe it. I had to rely on wireless adapters for my desktop for years, and I was not happy with periodic slowdowns and interference from other users. I wasn't able to link directly to my router due to it being on the other side of the house.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Powerline adapter is the perfect solution aside from running a lengthy cable. They plug in easily and don't require additional setup. One to the router, and one in another room. There are security and power saving features, but I haven't bothered to test them, I simply unplug both adapters when I don't need them.\n",
        "\n",
        "The only things to note here are that the adapters must be plugged directly into the wall plug. They cannot be used with extension cords or power strips, as well as UPS devices. I also tend to get a amber/red Powerline LED light which indicates slower transfer rates, but on my computer I've retained a constant 100 MB/s transfer rate, as limited by my computer network adapter.\n",
        "\n",
        "I haven't tried it with online gaming or consoles such as the Xbox, because I originally wanted to test it for reduced latency compared to wireless. If I do, I'll add it to my review later. Decided to downsize my home theater and wanted something with good sound. Bought the Sonos Soundbar but was disappointed. For the price it lacked great sound unless you paired it with the subwoofer.\n",
        "\n",
        "The salesman suggested the Energy. After reading several reviews cans hearing it in store it was a easy choice. The sound is great for my bonus room. It blends in well with my TV. The sub works and adds the depth lacking with the Sonos. For the price you will not be disappointed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Wish it had the ability to stream wirelessly via Bluetooth and more component connections via HDMI. However I knew this when I made the purchase. Such a light product that allows 100% Microsoft Office compatibility using their Hancock interface. Unlike the iPad, this can be used as a laptop and not just a viewer or gamer toy. If you want to create or edit Microsoft files - this is it. If you want a great desktop tower, this computer is good for productivity, gaming, virtualization, and storage capacity. I highly recommend this computer. Love my new I-phone 5s. I had an old 4 with out Siri and wish I had upgraded sooner. It is great to be able to dictate texts, or ask the phone to call someone. Love the case and the functionality. Looks and fits great on the phone. It actually replaces the back cover of the phone and being made by Samsung I'm sure it will maintain the IP-67 standard for water resistance. The only thing that could be improved would be to have a magnetic catch to keep it closed. I don't have a problem with it staying closed but in case I dropped the phone it would be nice to have it not open on the way down. I have seen a magnetic catch that is made by a 3rd party to attach to the case but $10 is a bit much. Good purchase This was an interesting movie that has recaptured my fondness for Disney movies again! The Avett Brothers latest album is just as great as there old albums. Can't get enough of them. If you like watching Keven Hart do stand up acts, this is one to own now! You will laugh until your stomach hurts. Works great I mean its a case the only thing that is bad is the price, if this was a bit cheaper it would be a whole lot better We were looking for a wireless system but did not find a lot of options. We wanted all speakers to be wireless and not just the subwoofer like most systems. We thought this unit was a bit pricey (still do) but decided to take a chance. The sound quality is great and the unit looks great. The subwoofer has a nice sleek look. We are happy with the purchase. The phone app is cool enough to impress my teenage kids so that is a big plus. You can control volume and play your phones playlist through the app. I am thinking of buying another pair so that I can stream the same music throughout the house. Setup was pretty easy. I like it so far. Easily set up to multiple items. If you looking for a controller and on a college budget, this is a good enough choice. Set up was quick and the mouse is a nice size and comfortable for my small hands. I like the Riddick series, so this was enjoyable to watch. I purchased this to be able to have all the things I need for my meeting at the club in one bag. I would recommend this to anyone great buy for the money. Great pair of earbuds and its always cool to rep your favorite team! This TV has a good picture quality, even on standard-def programming, and a wide viewing angle. Sound quality is reasonable, but a home theater enthusiast would probably want to add a sound bar or external speakers. The stand is not as sturdy as I would like, though this has not been a serious problem for me so far. It's not a smart TV, so you need a separate connection thru a media streaming device or web-enabled Blu-Ray player to access Internet content. I wish it had 3 HDMI inputs instead of only 2. As far as computer protection goes this ranks very well against the more expensive programs. Overall, I think this was a smart purchase for me. Wasn't sure about paying more or less for a cord but the picture quality is great so I think it was worth it. I purchased 2 of these HP monitors for my office and they are really great for what they cost.  I bought this one and a blue one for my nephew, and we had at least 2 hours of fun with it before we even put a game in the system. The picture is amazing. The touch screen works really well. It's comfortable to hold, and the placement of the controls seems to work smoothly. About the only thing I can think of now that could be better is a slightly wider choice of accessories. Like stylus' and cases. My nephew and I have really enjoyed the system in just the short amount of time we've had it. I recommend when you buy one, get one for a friend and play together. :) We gave this to my husband as a birthday present. It took about 5 minutes to set up and is working great. It's a good value. These are very serviceable earbuds, especially at this low price. Just don't expect much bass response. When using the keyboard, most of the time it does what it is supposed to do.\n",
        "however, when logging in with a password for Microsoft, there appears to be a lag time, ad even thought the p/w is entered correctly, the message is that there is an error. Have had to enter it 3 times before ti would work from the keyboard. Nothing negative to say. Great value. Easy to use. The story gives the audience an uncluttered version of the real Mary Poppins story with life lessons along the way. I needed this to add money to my son's tablet, it was an easy way to add funds to the Google play store. An easy choice. Great bang for your buck. I highly recommend. I initially wanted to buy the Kindle Fire, but the associate recommended the Samsung tablet because you can do more for a comparable price. I found that to be very true. Plus, I can still download the Kindle app for books, as well as Google Books, and e-books from the library. PLUS, games, Netflix, Hulu and general web-surfing. It's so small, but the resolution is great. While traveling, I synced it my portable blue-tooth speaker, and the sound quality was awesome to watch a movie. I highly recommend this product. Nothing negative about this product to date. Easy install and from what the sales person told me does not use a lot of storage on PC. I really like the Neon Trees. This album was a little different for them and I really like that they took a chance on something else. Once we managed to get this controller set up it was great. The setup was a pain, not sure what we did different but on the 8th or 9th try it just worked and has ever since. I've used most of the components , so far so good . Its much smaller than my last unit . The touch screen is wonderful. It quickly connects to my wireless signal. Faxing capabilities marvelous and loading printer paper is so easy, paper jams are a thing of the past. thank-you Looking forward to watching some movies and buying some games. 128GB (all my data files) on a single flash drive in my pocket. Got it at a sale price, so can't beat that. At least until the next generation.\n",

        "Mostly as an occasional backup source. Also can use when away from home. Works with tablet (android) as well. This movie was awesome. We spent a whole weekend and watched all 8 movies. They were great. We will watch them many more time to come. The movie was very interesting what Disney and his staff had the troubles to make \"MARY POPPINS\" Tom Hanks portrayed Walt Disney. It is portable, easy screen to use..Love it I can put it in my purse and take any where Overall storyline allowed the audience to take a closer on how people can be dysfunctional regardless of his or her status, social or class. It is really fun and challenging to play on the 3DS. Good product and does exactly what I need it to do. Great CD. Lots of up beat positive songs. Fun to listen to and dance to. Well worth the money. Would recommend it but not for minors. I have been using portable radios outside and at the beach. One of my freinds does the same, and is always messing with the antena, station etc. Now I just link this product, and play what ever music my iPhone has. I always have the iphone with me, so having just a better speaker was the fix. I love this product. When away on business, I can connect it to my iPad, play a movie, now the sound comes from the Sound Link Mini. Battery life is very good, and can use it all day! My wife is a huge fan of this show, which offers a modern update to the Sherlock Holmes character. Easy to install and works great for streaming on multiple devices. enjoyed yet another disney princess movie. there's enough humor to keep the parents entertained. This was a gift, so I really can't say much about the functionality. It was a good price for a beginner tablet that was grownup enough for a nine year old. So many of the tablet geared toward children are very limited, it was difficult to find something she was happy with. My kids watch this movie constantl and very entertaining for the family. We got this for my mother-in-law to print recipes and coupons from her iPad. It does just about everything she needs it to. Our only complaint is that it cannot print from actual coupons pages (smartsource.com, redplum.com, etc), she must have the app for it. Only Coupons.com has one. This is not the e-printers fault, so not an issue here. The product itself is very good. I purchased this keyboard as a replacement for the stock keyboard with my desktop after it failed without warning. Since I have gravitated towards my laptop and tablet more than my desktop I did not want to spend much on a keyboard yet did not want to lose any of the quick one button functions. This keyboard was the right price with almost identical one button functions. Also, it may be personal bias, but I have noticed the keys themselves seem to have a softer feel when depressed and are more responsive than the stock keyboard it replaced.\n",
        "Bottom line is it does what it should well with little financial investment. decent power and range. external materials are plastic, but dont appear cheap looking. I picked up a comparable flash drive (PNY) and it didn't work with my Mac or Xbox. The Sandisk version was cheaper and works great! This is the final season of Fringe. Gone is the storyline of the parallel worlds that probably got this show canceled. This is a wrapup to The Observers story. It takes place in the future with the team waking up from amber by Olivia and Peter's daughter to a world ruled by The Observers, future humans who polluted their world and own people with science to an extent that they go back to find a new home in the past. This season was one of the best with an epic finale that finishes the story perfectly. Must see! I bought this for a new TV that we just purchased for the bedroom.\n",
        "Now.....how can you rate something until it is put into actual use....protecting the equipment against a surge of electricity, which I'm sure we will have so will let you know later. For my son, it was the game to have...... He is able to play with his friends over the internet. He is pleased Bought these for the gym and they work great. Fits great and locks into the ear. It also blocks out the annoying music blasting at the gym. My wife is a huge fan of this book series and I must say I have been thoroughly pleased with both the first and now second of the films. Usually when Hollywood adapts a book to the big screen they butcher it in order to make a fast buck, however, my wife has stated numerous times how the films have been faithful to the books as best as she has ever seen. Having not read the books I can say from a film only perspective that the plot and setting of the films truly grip you from the beginning. One can relate to the plight of the districts while being amazed at the carnage of the games themselves as portrayed by the cast and the filmmakers eye. Subtle musical cues and extravagant color schemes bring this tale to life and if HD is your thing, this film will not disappoint. I find, from a movie aspect, very little to be negative on other than the fact that when the film is over, you long for more. We bought this for my 14 year old grandson's room.\n",
        "He really likes it. Very easy to use and works great. This was just what needed to speed up the speed throughout my 3 story, 6000 square foot house. The ear pieces are so comfortable. I can wear them and not have any pain in my ear like with lower costing brands duracell is always a good battery to use for electronics Excellent comfort and makes for easy listening. Would purchase more of this brand had some minor technical difficulties getting it to work but once Microsoft took care of me, I was back online playing games against other players and streaming movies from Netflix. The first season was good but the second season was great. This season starts after the audience's realization that The Machine isn't just a computer program but a sentient being. Last season was more of series of missions to help others with this season mixes more of the story of The Machine itself and why Finch created it to think and feel as well as the governments hold on it. We are introduced to two new characters, Root and Shaw. Root is a brilliant hacker, as brilliant as Finch, but with a twist. She's a complete psychopath. Her objective is to free The Machine and worship it as her god. And she will kill anyone who gets in her way. Shaw is another CIA assassin like Reese who is betrayed by her agency when she asks too many questions about her assignments and too close to their secrets. She is inherently good like Reese but a sociopath; lacking any feeling or empathy. The writing is great this year with a more complicated story line than last. There is still plenty of action but with a few more twits and turns. If you are a fan of Burn Notice give this a try. It's a darker show but better written. Enjoy. Purple Case for Samsung Galaxy, Fits snug, protects phone, overall no major problems, performs its task. My wife is a huge fan of this show, which offers a modern update to the Sherlock Holmes character. I bought this for my wife like she asked, and found myself listening to it as much as she does. I was anticipating the release as there are not a ton of games on Xbox One that are impressive. I am a long time Halo fan, and was hoping for more from Titanfall. The concept is good but feels repeatitive. Well this was my first experience with Chromecast and I had hoped I would be able to stream via bluetooth tethered through my new phone but alas you have to use wifi if there was any option other than wifi it would be 5 stars but alas... Streamlined interface and would recommend it to someone who has high speed internet and an established wireless home network but not for someone who only has cellular or satellite internet. This is a great product and the only negative is the potential battery usage if you do not turn off the mouse after each use. i would recommend this computer to anyone for home or business it just works I am an amateur photographer and I needed a high-quality high-res monitor to process my pictures. I also liked the 10-bit color that is available with this unit. I couldn\u2019t afford the top-rated IPS display, but this monitor is a great compromise. It is very sharp and clear edge-to-edge with very fine pixel-pitch with manual color, brightness and contrast control available; important because I just don\u2019t trust factory adjustments. When I plugged it in to my video card with a 3-meter Display Port cable it came up immediately at the native 2560x1440 resolution with audio (like HDMI, DP supports audio). The stand seems quite sturdy and it raises/lowers and tilts fore/aft easily. It also has some other nice features too like a built-in USB 3.0/2.0 hub and the ability to swing it into portrait-mode orientation complete with an auto-screen adjustment. Theoretically you can also set it to use different display settings for different applications, but I haven\u2019t tried that yet. I set the gross adjustments on the monitor and then ran it through my monitor calibration device and there were just some minor tweaks necessary. The only criticism that I can make is that the built-in speakers sound lousy \u2013 but then ALL built-in monitor speakers sound lousy and if you are spending this kind of money on a display you should also spend a few bucks more on decent sound \u2013 so I don\u2019t hold the audio against the monitor itself.\n",

        "I like. It's a nice item to purchase discounted games on the Playstation Network This is a good movie for kids. Its funny and Adam Sandler did a great job Works well, but more excited about the TV than a wall mount that will hold it up. Have a 50 inch Samsung Smart TV. It does the job and does all I could expect a TV Wall Mount to do. Purchased on sale so got a great deal This is a good movies I recommend this movie to anyone who likes action. i would recommend to my all family and all my friends This product was very easy to setup and use. So far really only using Netflix access. Me and my daughter really enjoyed watching the movie. Great songs It was a really good movie! Leo should have won an oscar for his performance Worth it had the other one but the back lit is the only way to go on any keyboard. I needed some thing to back up my computer. This has lots of storage on it. So I can back up things on my other computer too. It also puts a icon on your desk top so it easy to access it. I would recommend this to any one.\n",
        "You need to back up your pc incase your computer crashes. Simply opened package and plugged into the USB and worked right away. easy to install and especially like that the mouse has storage for the connector right inside the mouse. Quiet and spacious with lots of movable shelves. Only complaint is that the ice and water will not work if one of the other doors is open. All together pleased with the purchase. Feels solid, but may get torn over time due to stiffness of fabric. Magnetic features enabled but much cheaper than Apple brand product. Bought this primarily to hook up to PC at cheapest price point possible. Does the job, with a lengthy cord. I am happy with my selection. I would recommend buying a case for it. The Rose Gold is nice. The letters and numbers are large. My wife is a huge fan of this show, which offers a modern update to the Sherlock Holmes character. Love it! This camera is so easy to use and very light weight! Takes great pictures! Would buy another one if this one broke! My Neighbors will hate me, Sounds Excellent with a deep bass . Very Easy Setup , took me About an Hour. They should give you more wire for your speakers. But for a Mid size living room It will Rock your House. Great exciting game so far, bought for a friend but he didn't want it so i kept it for myself! kids play a lot. They like to connect with friends online The cord broke on my daughter's laptop and I was looking for a replacement that wouldn't break the bank. This did the trick! The cord is easy to use, just pick the plug size you need and plug it in. Long hours of playing. Kids play a lot. money saving I got this due to issues with my now \"senior\" dog, and it has really helped make the carpet look almost new again. Dual computers can easily use for internet services. Good product for the price. Easy navigation. Only took minutes to figure out the navigation and set up. This is really one of the best movies Disney has put out in a long time. I love that it is about the sister bond, rather than the traditionally fairy tale love story. The music is also adorable. I can't stop watching it and singing the songs. I decided to purchase this movie based on the info on the back of the bluray. Was surprised to find it was actually a good movie. Sometimes they just dont give enough info on the cover to decide if its worth purchasing or not. kids play a lot. They like to connect with friends online I love buying the combo packs because I can give one as a gift and also stream if I'm not in my living room. This movie also had some great extras about the making of. I haven't watched the movie yet but I will like it Definitely recommend as a family movie; great cinematography and acting Good picture and it takes up a lot less room than my old cathode ray tube television. The new televisions are so light very simple and easy to use - just put in your memory stick and watch your pictures as a beautiful slide show on a decent size screen. Perfect Case, lightwieght and can store laptop cord and other supplys. Well made, nice color. I picked up this laptop sleeve for a 15.6 inch HP Touchsmart laptop. The padding on the inside is very soft and provides a decent amount of protection for the laptop. The only real downsides are that the outside is prone to attracting debris such as pet hair and that a typical AC adapter does not really fit in the accessory pouch (a laptop bag would be more suitable for that). Overall, I am happy with the purchase. I have 3 apple tv's and love them. Easy to watch movies, play music, show what's on the computer screen, family photo's etc. Fairly easy to hook up and use. Bought this as a gift for someone. They totally enjoyed it. This movie is awesome! It has some of the catchiest songs I've ever heard in my life. Was able to store all the pictures i took on a 3 week European vacation! An improvement from his first album. Good production and melodies, hot features. I didn't skip a track. Fun to listen to . We have tried other Mocha's out there and this is the best tasting one we can find. Easy to use, the size is perfect, fits easy in pocket, purse, etc. Stores a lot of music, easy to run with. Love it! Even though I saw Frozen in the theaters, my wife and I knew that we would get the DVD when it came out. We actually were going to get the DVD, but when BB had the pre-sale for this movie in Blu-Ray that was the same price as the DVD, we pulled the trigger on the Blu-Ray.\n",

        "This is not your cookie cutter Disney movie. There is a huge plot twist that will keep you on the edge of your seat. I don't want to give it away, but just go get Frozen. You won't be sorry. Would be great for small stain or spill, worked on red wine spill. I debated for a long time about adding pedestals or not. I'm glad i did. It's expensive but really worth it. it brings the front loading machines to a more comfortable level to be getting the laundry without straining your back. The storage underneath is perfect for all your laundry needs and they look great. Easy to install other than moving the heavy washer and dryer, but even still well worth it! If you are looking for a small tv for a kitched or kids room I suggest this one, it is awesome. A quality cable that has a reliable fast connection. If you are just a little bit of a Disney fan (even though I love Disney) this is a must see movie. I have always enjoyed old time Disney and the way Tom Hanks played Walt, he brought him back to life!\n",

        "I enjoyed this movie thoroughly and even the Blu-Ray extras were great.\n",

        "Get this movie or at least put it on your watch list!  I was pretty excited to play WD after picking it up. Several of my friends shared in my excitement too. Overall the game is fun but it does remind me of GTA. Sonos is easy to setup and go! Great sound with lots of music options. Used this item to make music of insprirational songs. I did not realize that the computer problems that I was having was due to my USB adapter. I was using a single band when I needed a dual band. With this adapter, my computer is performing as it should. The headphones has good quality, the sound is perfect and it can diminished outside noise very well. There is comfortable design too. Price is too high though for a student. Was a great movie, well done. Quality was great on blu-ray and the sound in the movie particularly stood out. Entertaining movie overall. I like that they introduced the new ability hyper nova. I enjoyed the vibrant artwork presented in the game and the game play feature did not feel tacked on but well developed. I love how the rare keychains are so well hidden and the luck factor of the normal keychains. The control were spot on and there was a lot of replay value in the game. I love how the bosses all use 3D background. However, I wish that there was an option not to use gyro control. I've never used the 3D,\n",

        "All members of my family happily use the Blu Ray player. Even my technophobe wife. I really enjoy the way it automatically interacts with my Samsung TV. When we use the cable remote to increase the volume, the surround sound volume increases instead of the TV volume.\n",
        "\n",
        "My 20 year old surround sound died awhile ago. My family wasn't used to surround sound, and the first few days were constantly wondering about the sounds from behind and beside them. I would say the surround works well. I definitely missed the subwoofer, and it works well enough for me, and sometimes too well for my wife.\n",

        "The children (ages range from 22 - 5) watch YouTube and Netflix all the time with no complaints. I use a wired connection and have 100 Mbit mostly stable cable connection, so your mileage may vary. This is my first LG Dryer that I have bought. It has made my life easier to put the clothes in the dryer and walk away to when the dryer plays music to let me know it's done. This machine is easy to use. Glad I purchased it. It surpassed all of my expectations and more. Overall great show. I understand it deviates slightly from the books, but still worth a watch. Beautiful on blu-ray as well. I bought this because I had one go bad and had lots of ink left and this one was suppose to use same ink ...well it did not and I check back on the BB web sight and it said it would use a 69 black but was a mistake by BB hope they took it off other wise work as promised The movie was great, i am a fan of the hobbit so love the series but they could make some parts shorter so its not so long. The headphone are great for shutting out sound. Great when flying. I am also surprised Sonicare is still making this model. I have owned Sonicares for years, probably bought 6-7 of them and my whole family has them. There have been several generations of Sonicare, and up until the most recent generation, they had two critical flaws in my book, and this model shares those flaws: (1) they only work on 110v - so if you travel outside the Americas, you have to carry a heavy converter (not adapter, voltage converter) or else they burn out and (2) the brush head is poorly designed so that water and saliva goes down into a reservoir inside which becomes a gunky stinky mess. The entry level new design corrects both of these problems and is available on Amazon for about $10 more than this one -- and well worth it. It's called the Sonicare Easy Clean. Philips Sonicare HX6511/50 Easy Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush\n",
        "\n",
        "Hope this helps... if you order this brush, just know about the two flaws above... other wise, like all Sonicares, it provides excellent cleaning and you'll love using it. If price is your main consideration over all else, this is the model... otherwise spend a little bit more for the Easy Clean.\n",

        "Hope this helps! Schecter makes some of the highest quality \"affordable\" guitars and this Damien Elite 7 is one of the best choices available these days.\n",
        "It has a very comfortable playing neck, not baseball bat like at all so it wasn't a huge adjustment going from a 6 string to this extended scale 26.5 \" neck. Also, the gothic cross inlays on the rosewood fretboard give it a great look as well.\n",
        "Comes with the EMG 81/85 Active pickups which really help this thing spew out some heavy crushing riffs as well as some good clean tones when needed.\n",
        "Has nice grover tuners and a tune-o-matic bridge which keep it in tune very well, and the string through body design helps the sustain.\n",
        "The picture does not show how beautiful the Crimson Red quilted maple top looks in person and along with a well balanced mahogany body and maple neck, you have a great setup.\n",
        "The only change I made was to upgrade to the Dunlop Heavy Core strings with gauges 10 - 60 as this comes from the factory with 10 - 56 which caused some fret buzzing.\n",
        "After the string change I did a slight neck,bridge and pickup adjustment and the buzz was gone and it sounds great.\n",
        "The best part was getting it on clearance from BB at under $300, which was the cheapest around.\n",
        "GET IT YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED AT ALL !!! This product is AWESOME!! I'm a personal trainer!! Funniest Movie I've seen in years. Non stop laughs As also usual with Tyler Perry's work there is always a message. This play is no different. This play made me laugh and think. I like that these headphones can be worn for a few hours with no discomfort. The sound quality is also excellent. These are the best I have ever used. we planned to go to Disneyland this month and I was thinking a lot about my daughter ( 2 years and half old ) how to entertain her all the way ( 6 hours driving ) , she likes to watch cartoon and other videos like ABC Alphabet , so I did the right decision to purchase this product and we could control her screen what to watch by the other one my wife had it in the front , plus we used the second monitor when we stayed at hotel for 5 days , I recommend every parents to have this dvd player for their kids . I Love Hp products. Great stuff and easy to use. Save Money. Just one of those movies you watch over and over! Great story. towards the end the series went off track by traveling back into an alterated future- My opiniion failed move. The game is well made, looks great graphically, and is fun to play. The main negative I see so far is that the menu/nav systems aren't as intuitive as they could be. Some features of the game are not well explained. This doesn't take away from the experience of the game overall, though. The concepts are fun, the hacking is great, the ways in which you influence the environment are creative and interesting. Blast to play overall, could be lost in the open world of it for hours :) Very glad I made the purchase. The thirst quencher has arrived! Greatness has arrived! I've only played about 45 minutes of this game but enjoyed it. It seems like a cross between GTA and Assassins Creed, but better. The plot is pretty good but they tried to spin off of Cars too much and should have made a new movie. Enjoyable movie for parents and kids but not the best. Great picture, good quality, great sound, excellent price, easy set up, perfect size! Samsung is great brand that I bought 2 TVs that day! good product. easy to use and set up. don't like the control pad. it needs to be a touch pad. my finger hurts when i need to delete a lot of emails at once I purchased this product for my big master bedroom and it works very good , it is easy to install the vent pipe to the window and just turn it on , that is it , I'm very happy with this product. one button hacking , free roam and exploration what more do u need I preordered this game for all the perks it came with: 70 club Nintendo coins, free game download, $10 buck gas card (although I've never gotten it yet, I'm not sure how to get it actually). Put the game right in and it was everything I expected and more. The Mario Kart series keeps getting better and better. The new anti gravity interested me and I was wondering how that was going to play. I thought it was a great idea, but it seems to not really get too much into anti gravity all too much. The feel of it was just a little off for some reason, but watching the replay of the races makes it look great! I guess I was expecting for it to \"feel\" like I was going upside down or something or rumble some more or something.\n",
        "\n",
        "Enough, about the anti gravity, the graphics keep getting better and better. I love the way Nintendo has been evolving with all their characters and improving the graphics as they go. The attention to detail with all the characters makes it look realisticly smooth. I get so distracted watching the beautiful background that it ruins how I play. Hopefully, I can get used to it eventually.\n",
        "\n",
        "The customization and characters you can choose from is vastly abundant. Everyone you play with online each has its unique look. It's almost impossible for two players to have the same look.\n",
        "\n",
        "The difficulty of the cpu seems to have gotten a little harder with each new Mario Kart that comes out and this one is no exception. It's almost like each new Mario Kart trains you for the next one that comes out. With the new items it puts a different spin on things. The way the game is designed always seems to be good at keeping the pack together. When you are ahead, you get a barrage of attacks from everyone behind and when you are behind, you get some boosts to keep you in the game. I do enjoy all the possible ways of gaining a boost. They're everywhere!\n",
        "\n",
        "The online play is extremely challenging! Everyone is just so good. It's fun playing with a group of people that keeps the game challenging enough to want to improve yourself. It's almost discouraging for never getting first place, but that doesn't stop me for trying harder.\n",
        "\n",
        "This game is great for a solid 4 stars. Bringing in some of the old courses with a brand new anti gravity twist and the original courses this has to offer will keep you playing for a long time. Especially, if you challenge yourself with people around the world. Needed an external storage device to backup my MacBook Pro. Based on other reviews, this product seemed to have the best balance of affordability and reliability. This external drive is easy to set up (just plug and play) and functions just like I hoped it would. It's still new but so far I have had no issues with it. Would definitely recommend this for anyone looking to use Time Machine to back up their Mac computer/laptop. this cable is priced much less then others. no issues great quality I have been waiting for this game since the ps4 came out and the game was delayed until spring. Can't wit to start playing the game but I'm sure it will be very entertaining. Good action, funny moments, good acting an overall good movie. If you liked the first Men In Black, I think you may enjoy this. This game is amazing. The graphics are killer and the game runs super smooth and I have not found any frame rate drops at all. The sound is killer with my surround sound system as well. Nintendo did a great job with this and with the bonus of a free game if you register MK8 on club nintendo by the end of June, well, that make this purchase a no brainer. It is a good computer but from what I see it isn't as fast as I had thought. That disappoints me. It is a lot of money to be that slow. As for windows 8 Wow!!! It isn't the easiest to learn. I am sure once I lean it it will be fine. I have always liked Dell. I have had one before and was very well satisfied. Love it, for price is wonderful. Charge unit fits nicely on side stand perfect for grabbing a controller at any time. Both batteries work great, hold charge like any other. Great buy. Makes good use of 3D and does add some new life to this classic. It's so nice to be able to charge and recharge, rather than using old school batteries. I like too that you can plug it into the wall instead of the console like some chargers/systems require. Love this camera, wifi app is perfect. No need for a computer unless editing. Just review pics on phone &amp; email. Lickity split. For memory, camera pixels, usb port, screen size and wifi, it was a greater value for price than competion. Being a fan of the original cartoon shorts, I enjoyed this very much. Excellent Phone for the home! Easy set-up! Excellent Quality &amp; Great Price! Great item. Had Plantronics earlier model and they were terrible. This set is perfect, highly recommend. Protects the entire iPad with a strong yet lightweight polyurethane. The cover is thin but strong, protecting the screen quite well. The cover folds into the stand and there are limited positions and it is not the most stable. For most applications, this is perfect, but reading on a train or plane during bumps and turbulence was just a bit challenging. Good thriller, good acting, good pacing. I enjoyed it. For the Money, These Jam Plus speakers are my go-to speaker for parties, sitting on the deck, I even take them in my car and use them with my phone...For the money, and whats out there now, these speakers are tops in their price range. So great, I went and got a second the next day...the pair is awesome. I actually got mine on sale. I didnt want to spend a lot of money on a laptop that i know i was only going to use it for school. Watching movies on it is also good cause of the audio system This is a great album at a great price. Really good solo release from damon albarn. The genius blur frontman not to mention all the other great bands like gorrillaz The phone was purchased for is features. It serves my need perfectly. Great movie, animation style fits well with the theme. The 3D is excellent colors pop picture is crisp. I don't need the massive amount of space for downloads so this console is perfect for those that just want to play games. Easy to install and very fast. Will always be my go to ink. Great TV for the price. Would have been nice to not have to wait for 1 1/2 hrs for the associate to find it then couldn't find it. Had to choose a different tv however finally a manager found it. Works extremely well for non-work. It can be difficult for work as it cannot be used with a mouse. The touch screen alternative is no intuitive.\n",
        "In addition, dropping the tablet from short heights can crack the screen. Needed a charger for my computer. Bought this one, has many tips to fit almost any computer. So in the event another charger is lost during travel for another computer, will be able to use this charger for that computer. I love my fitbit. It reminds me to park far away so I get extra steps in for the day. Must have PSN account to play online games. Easy to purchase this card and enter activation code. Best deal is to purchase 1 year membership. Works just as advertised. Good product for your money. Great product but expensive compare to others, sound quality is avergae for the price. My headset system is awesome for listening to music an telephone conversation.\n",
        "Sound system is great and microphone quality is excellent I always purchase cables with the Apple Brand... have some issues with off brands in the past... this was a perfect addition to the fable universe! if you love fable games get this Good item overall! I recomend this item. Awesome performace and power saver. Attractive to all of co workers. Easily fits in pocket/purse no other phone like it out there . I buy this ink for my printer at house used for my real estate business.\n",
        "The quality and price is ok. had a lot of fun with this game. played for hours!! good game. lots of fun. if you have an xbox buy this!! Sorry to see this TV series go! Very good TV show! Good investment, and bought mainly because of all the apps available for the iPad. Future integration with camera is on the horizon. The product is good and whoever developed it came with a smart idea which is a storage of data without paying extra fees.The thing that took me longer to get to use to is the software and the time to understand the apps.Despite that, I still like the product. Happy Happy Happy Happy Happy Happy Happy Happy Happy! I have owned the system for approximately 30 days now and could not be happier. Sony did a great job making a system that was powerful and relatively inexpensive. A good value overall. What can I say? They're batteries. Great batteries at that....my karaoke machine microphones rely on long lasting batteries to last longer than the party. These do a great job! I purchased this game with my PS4. The game has very solid gameplay, graphics and sound. I found the main career mode to be lengthy and provide a lot of content. You must be a PS+ member to play the game online in any way and will be constantly reminded of that every time you start the game. I purchased this to have an additional charger for my cell phone. I have not had any problems with the product. Very good action movie. A must see movie. Giant robots and Giant monster, Bought this Canon G16 as a secondary camera replacing my 12 year old Power Shot A540 .I use this G16 camera when heavier DSLR is not needed. G16 model is a great camera takes great pics especially in low light and HD video is fantastic too. Started to use it about 6 months ago and I am very pleased with it and overall performance is very satisfying too.G16 model has and delivers what I expected from this camera. I would recommend it to a friend. I purchased this item to replace my old basement refrigerator. I did not want a model that had a lot of features such as water or ice maker. I have now owned this item for approximately one month and it is working as expected. I needed to protect my phone and immediately thought \"Otterbox\" can't go wrong with it! The winner was super excited to win this at post-prom !! I recommend this product is usefull protects the tablet, nice color, excellent choice. Best printer I've owned. Wireless connection is great. Prints crystal clear pictures and two-sided documents. Easy to set up. Needed replacement mic for karaoke jukebox...this mic fit the bill perfectly. Sounds good with little to no feedback. A really compact size satellite receiver to go well with an aftermarket head unit. Easy install and great features! This is a really good game. Would recommend to people that are willing to play a game for awhile. Is kind of confusing at times as what you are suppose to be doing. Better quality, crystal clear, good color, energy saver and sophisticated remote! I love when these guys make movies. Not what I expected but a fun movie. A solid piece, worth every penny to compliment the Galaxy Note 3. Great integrated features! Rocketfish is a reliable product and you know you are getting a good product when you purchase them. Watchdogs is the best game out for the PS4 to date. The game really showcases the power of the next generation of gaming. Worth the money. 70's movies usually miss the mark but this movie did a great job. Purchase item, took it home, and it Works like its supposed to. The cartridges are easy to insert in the printer. There is never any leakage or mess. My son and I can't stop playing it's so much fun and intense best Mario Kart so far! Disclaimer: I've only had the change to play this game for about an hour, so take what follows with a grain of salt:\n",
        "\n",
        "This game looks gorgeous. The dialogue and voice acting seem very well done (Jordi, the main character's first accomplice you meet at the start of the game, is a hoot). The hacking element seems very well done. Stealth segments that I ran across force you to think your way through a situation and is rewarding when you pull it off.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition, the game world is quite large, the driving mechanics are from the team behind the Driver series (meaning it can't be all that bad), the minigames are fun, and the multiplayer invasions keep you on the edge of your seat.\n",
        "\n",
        "All that being said, as alive as the game world seems, it's a bit watered down that what we've seen from its E3 showings the past couple years. And if the main character got his niece killed due to his criminal actions and are hunting down the men responsible, why do you then get the choice to blindly go through and have the option to steal money from people, murder them, etc.? Grand Theft Auto IV's Niko Bellic was the same way and made it extremely had to sympathize with the protagonist.\n",
        "\n",
        "All in all, don't expect a revolutionary \"next-gen\" experience, but DO expect a very fun and exciting open-world experience! I love this double oven! I've always wanted one and when the chance to remodel my kitchen, this was at the top of my list. This is perfect! I love baking! It meets all my needs! I had to get use to the smell of the newness while on for the first couple of weeks, but it is gone now. And I'm learning to ignore the sound of cooling itself down, which I like knowing that it is. But those are minor verses how much I love this product!  First to start off I'm pretty new to this windows 8 stuff, I like it but don't love it. I have had this Asus for over a month, I can't say that I've used it to its fullest abilities. Touch screen windows 8 is pretty new to me, but its awesome! I really like the fact that there is a button (function button) to turn on the keyboard led lights. I like the fact that it has a full keyboard plus number pad, but the numbers are to compact. HDMI works super fast, has 3 usbs which one is a fast charging, mic and headphone input (something new). Maybe one of the most important things, this pc gets more then 4 or 5 hours of battery life, I get almost 6-8 hours. I'll charger it full then keep it off the charger til about 20%, that's the best way to keep the battery lasting long for a while. Don't keep the charger on overnight or more than 3 hours. Love working on excel and power point.\n",
        "\n",
        "The only bad thing about this pc I have found is that the mouse sticks from time to time, no cd drive and the fact that it has an internal battery. Which maybe a good thing, but when you consider the fact you cannot replace on your own it sucks. SO I recommend getting the warranty. Excellent game but there is too much narrative. The game is progressively challenging, which makes it enjoyable to play. My little one loves it. It was so entertaining that we all sing along. Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 is a wonderful sequel! The characters return for another adventure when keeps you tuned in to the very end. I highly recommend the movie for any age group! We have several LG appliances and they all work very well. They are a good value for a high quality product. The microwave is no different. This show is worth your time. Step away from the reality junk on most TV stations and watch a quality show like Game of Thrones. Blu ray looks amazing. This first season sets the stage for big events in the later seasons. product overall is not bad. You are able to hear pretty good with them after a workout. If your a fan of this series then you must follow though to the end to see how they closed it out. Actors were great. Story lines interesting. I love the Google Chromecast, no problems...no regrets. Item was as described. The only problem I had was in the actual cutting it to fit my phone. No way to get the perfect layout. The Truman Show was such a great movie! Jim Carrey was awesome in the movie and the acting overall was very good. And it was quite a unique story. It was great to see it on Blu-Ray. Love this refrigerator. Plenty of space, roomy, love the light for dispensing ice or water. As always the graphics were great and in was very interesting! One of the absolute best shows on TV right now, made even better on crystal clear blu ray. Pretty good case, sturdy case. It would be nice to have a Portrait mode stand in addition. Star Trek is a great series and this is a classic as the special effects are great and the acting of the Stars are awwwwwwsome! I have had the jbl for over a month and my wife and I love it. We purchased it main to pair with our new windows 8 laptop because we thought the audio was going to be bad but that wasn't the case. For such a little device its pretty powerful when its compared to a larger sound bar for your tv. I really like the fact that it came with a charger and a carrying case.\n",
        "\n",
        "The only bad thing about it, is if your out and drop it on something hard you can break it and scuff it up. Dropped mine once at a bbq This is a great router for the money. I would recommend it for a smaller place. This items works better than I expected. Sits flat on the wall, but moves easily when you want to change the angle. First off pay attention to the \"M\" rating. Read the explanations of why it had received this rating. This game is not intended for children what so ever. It is a good first person shooter with a good story line. There are 5 difficulty levels available from the start and then there is a possibility to unlock other game difficulty modes. There is no online multi-player so replay value will depend on each individual, I have done 2 play throughs and am finished with it. I found the game enjoyable but not great. Purchased modem, took it home, read directions, and it was extremely easy to set up. Got this to replace an old Qwest Modem. It works great, is fast and was easy to set up. So far awesome but theres so much content that this will take awhile,. But what I've gone through so far is awesome. One of the best games of the year. My kids liked the movie. They watched it a couple of times in a week span. I really love this TV. I set up Netflix on it and watch movies all day. It has the best picture and sound and was easy to set up. Also a great price, I would recommend this TV again and again! This system is great. Finally, came back to ps4. The titles are good and so is the PlayStation network. I'm glad I chose the PlayStation. The games are incredible and so are the movies. Now I just need a 4k TV and ill be in heaven. Also get watchdogs super awesome! This product is worth every penny. It has a protective screen cover and a very durable fit to my phone. I feel secure with this cover on my phone. It is very protective all around. My son really loves the Disney Infinity game. I use the disks as rewards for him when he does something nice. I give it to him randomly and it re-energizes the game for him. You never know what you are going to get out of the package. Any movie that I can enjoy just as much as my nieces is a good movie. I'm happy to share a movie I loved so much as a kid with them. I like this product because I can turn my iPod Classic into a amazing sound system when I connect it to my Bose blue tooth, and it 's so easy to use. The movie itself is well written and the acting is supreme. Whats not so great is the epic length to the movie. It runs around 3 hours long.. Was on sale, ended up cheaper and easier to set up than the others.Also runs in the background without slowing your computer down. Very funny and love Jim Carrey in this movie. Also, has Steve Carrell who's awesome! It fits on my galaxy s4 perfect very slim design so doesn't make phone so bulky. Zagg definitely makes the best screen protectors. Durable, easy to clean, works very well and the lifetime warranty is the best around. Purchased for my brother who has severe ms. The touchscreen really helps him because of his limited use of his hands. I like it a lot because it is compact and response to what you need to do! This is a feel good movie! So many great meanings and importance in our own lives. A must see! ............................\n",

It's not the most expensive version, but it does the job. No complaints We bought this when we set up our new tv and stereo area - everything is great. Good movie with great scenes of war and fighting. Lead actor is great. This player is small and was easy to set up. Haven't had any problems with it. It's exactly as I expected. Works great and it protects my phone's screen so I don't have to open it so much. This movie was so funny and the quality of the movie was great. This replaced my original fitbit zip that had done it's time and stopped being accurate. I absolutely love the Fitbit One...love the sleep tracking that I did not have with my Zip!

Really enjoyed all the Men in Black movies but this is my favorite one because of the ending. works well................................................................................................................................................. Plays many games. The controller feels great. Doubles as a blu ray player. Can stream Netflix as well. Bought this case and a Seagate Slim portable hard drive together. The case was inexpensive and fit the new Seagate external drive with some room to spare. It even has an outside pocket where you store your hard drive USB cable - nice. About the only one being made that's a namebrand but need a new one since old one died! This one is working great so far! Love this movie! Great plot and funny throughout. There is violence and language but otherwise its a clean movie. Good tv. Slight lag with the internet. Lots of features. Very satisfied. Would recommend to a friend. It is our primary TV. Young or old this is a cute movie. Easy to watch over &amp; over again. The characters are funny, the over all quality is wonderful. Great movie, love the music that was in it. Educational Bought this external hard drive for work to backup estimating and construction document data. At one terabyte I don't think I will ever max it out but being very busy at work and having a lot of data to backup it still may take a while.\n",
        "it's very light to carry in a backpack and extremely easy to use. Tracks steps well. Just a little disappointed that I can bike on a stationary bike for a half hour and when I check my progress in active minutes it reads zero. Also, doesn't have the availability to scan in food barcodes for fast recording of daily meals. Easy to use and clean. Its a good pedometer.

You know what you're getting when you purchase Apple earbuds and other than the fact that they can get dirty because they're white in color, it's a good and reliable product. Pleasantly surprised. Great mix of hits and songs I hadn't heard. After shopping around for months for the right refrigerator. I finally chose this one. It looks great and functions very well. It is very quiet. Good performances. Good length. Good soundtrack. Nice visuals I CAN SEE ALL MY WWE SHOWS FROM THE WWE NETWORK.

My little one loves it. Really reccomend for little ones Another great album from Alter Bridge! The first 7 songs are great and the title song, Fortress, is awesome as well. Shows off the abilities of the platform. But on the short side. I've been playing several android videogames and the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 performs awesome!!\n",
        "Easy to connect to wireless networks and surf on internet for school assignments.\n",
        "The battery last for a good while. I usually play while traveling with my family. Gives you a whole house WiFi system without having to install it in your walls or ceiling. Just wish it had a fuller sound for the price. just what you need to watch all you want any format Gives your the whole house speaker system without having to install it through your walls and ceiling. I purchased this computer about a month ago to replace a 4 year old Dell with a first generation Intel Core i3. I was attracted to this computer based upon its specs (I am a computer person, build my own desktops) and value for money. This honestly is the closest you are going to get to a MacBook Pro in a Windows PC. Windows 8.1 is great once you get used to it, but it will be a curve in the beginning from Windows 7 or XP. My one complaint about this computer was the slow hard drive. Hard drives don't do computers justice at all. I ended up putting a Samsung SSD in the machine, and the speed benefits are well worth the extra money. The battery life went up, and the speed is insane. If you are looking for a well built laptop that is very portable and fast, look no further. Highly recommend upgrading to a solid state drive. I had to get help setting up my previous Linksys wifi router, but this new router comes with an installation disc that does it all for you. You can use this on the Sony Entertainment Network to purchase/rent movies, music, and video game related downloads. Great price for a no nonsense tv. If you want great quality for a low price this is what you are looking for The product is perfect for my electronic, however its a bit of a struggle to put in on. The price is great. Received the car perk. The game really shows the possibilities with the new operating systems. JUST LIKE ALL THE COD GAMES ITS GOOD!I LIKE ALL THE NEW DLC Tim burton directs Sweeney Todd, and like Sleepy Hollow, this is great material for a talented filmmaker. Dark and chilling but still humorous and engaging, this demon barber cuts and slashes his way into your mind through the work of Steven Sondheim's stage show adapted for the screen by none other than Tim Burton. I've been a fan of Tim Burton and Johnny since I was a child and this film is just another in a long line of imaginative and unique collaborations between creative geniuses..... Love it! This player is the ideal Bluray for compact spaces and new technology. If you have the refrigerator that uses this filter, there is no reason not to use this filter. It is easy to install and lets you know when you need a new one, what's not to love! The Chromecast is a great device for watching Youtube and Netflix. Easy to set up and works with my android phone flawlessly (also works with Apple devices). You do need a home internet connection to make it work but once you set it up you can start watching immediately.\n",

        "The Chromecast is a cheap way to get youtube and netflix on your HDMI TV. I bought this to use with my Surface Pro 2 and it works great. Good feel I bought this controller to have an extra one so my daughter and I could play together on our Xbox. The best thing about the controller is that is purple so I didn't have to settle for the regular black controller and I also got a great deal when I bought it since it was on sale. This case is great for an ipod touch. With young kids it will protect the ipod. Bought due to seeing this after I had picked up my USB and It was on clearance for $3.00 so figured I couldn't pass it up! This the best headset I've ever owened, the quality and design are amazing and the price tag it's not bad Nice for traveling....easy on the eyes to read ...lightweight to hold. Overall this is a great wireless keyboard. I like that fact that it's smaller in size yet has a full set of keys including the 9 key. It takes up less space on my desk. The only down side to this keyboard is the tabs that prop the keyboard up fold down all the time and get on my nerves. Other than that though it's awesome. You've Got Mail is a great comedy with excellent portrayal of the characters by Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. Bought it to steam rice...it steams rice. Easy to clean. Win. Black, slim case for the iphone 5 or 5S. Having a slim light case makes it not bulky. The USB is great for music files especially how all the music is going to USB in vehicles. I got this for a factory installed USB Radio and it works great and holds all my music that I need!! This a great router for the price. Easy to set up and secure the connection and reliable, fast connection. Working great. Battery life might be a little low, but works for most of what I would expect it to. Notting Hill is a great storyline of how 2 people from different walks of life can meet and have an effect on each others's life and decisions This is a nice keyboard which connects to the Surface easily. It is large enough for touch typing. The right and left buttons are part of the touch pad and require some practice to use effectively. It is a good addition to the Surface; typing on it is far better than using the on-screen keyboard.  I love this tv because. Hdtv pip s nd my daughter love het new tv Easy set up with fast internet speed on multiple wifi devices. This printer has worked out wonderful. Another great product from Cannon!! This is a nice case for the Surface. It is large enough to hold the Surface with a Type keyboard. There is no extra room, and the front pocket can hold a few small items. I got this phone as a gift for my mother who isn't savvy with electronics. It was easy for her to set up and use. She's very happy with it. My phone had excessive battery drain which was caused by a defective microSD card. I replaced it with this one and battery life is back to normal. The Logitech wireless mouse is great. Easy to use and just the right size for any hand. Moves easily on any surface. Attractive and sounds good for its size. Price was right also. On a budget this case works great. It's not bulky at all and seems pretty resilient. As with all things Apple, it's expensive. But since the original cord stopped working, this new one was a necessary purchase. Bought this to hard wire the game systems and sattellite receivers in my home to free up my wifi for phones and tablets. Doing this improved connectivity and speed for both wired and wifi devices. I am using this printer for a while mainly for print and copy. It is slow but already expected for that. Quality is good. I tried all functions except fax. Everything works fine. When I installed the software in another computer, I cannot print or do anything. After searching in user guide and internet, I just need to reboot the network from printer. It took a while but it works fine now. I am happy with my purchase. good product I would buy it again. has big storage So this case can be used to hold and store 88 DVD' s /Blue Ray discs. Guess what ? It works! This is perfect for printing smaller pictures and ink does not smear very clear print This dvd was very helpful in showing my son how the character he was playing in WEST SIDE STORY acted in certain scenes. Great Product for the kids room, can access, they can find their own shows they want to watch without any help from mom. Love the not having to load and change movies in the DVD player. The ilhone 5s is a great phone and is full of new and better features, you will be happy with your purchase. Convenient to only purchase one package vs two separate also cost savings I used to have an old Epson printer that lasted me for a decade. Then I switched over to a HP wireless which was the worst tech decision that I have ever made. Then I went picked up this Epson and it's been flawless. No problems and can easily print from my phone and iPad. I recommend it to anyone who doesn't want printer headaches. It took me a couple of tries to get it installed properly but wasn't really difficult. I can't say that I've noticed a faster connection but it is more stable than my previous router. Really had a fun time platying this game Great graphics I have both the wireless mouse and keyboard for my laptop and working on it is so much easier and productive It's an awesome mount and I will get another soon for my living room wall We love this television. It is perfect for our daughter's room. The picture is very clear. What a great price it was too! This memory card is being used in a small computer and works great. Great blend!\n",
        "Review must be 50 characters. Are you kidding me. It's coffee and it's great coffee. Any other questions? HAHA The jaws for the gopro camera works great. I attach it to fences, trees, and whatever else I need to get the look I want with the camera. very versatile I had a previous set of Bose earbuds and they lasted 5 years. Once they shorted out I purchased a set of these. They sound amazing. Clearer then my previous set. This fit in my ear perfectly. It comes with 3 different sizes of ear pieces. They stay in place when Im at the gym. The blue is a drastic change then my black set. They look sweet and sound superb. Bass isn't too loud. Buy a pair and your ears will thank you. I love these headphones. I have wanted for a while and am very glad I made the purchase Couldn't wait for this movie. This DVD/blue ray is a great deal. I use this case for going to the gym. Works great! Highly recommend for iPhone 5s users used it three weeks. took it back, the air filters are very.$$$$. and you had to order them. Love the length of the cable, charging speeds seem accurate, and the price was fine. the speck candyshell protector cushions the phone whenever I have dropped it. the faceguard is also helpful to protect the face of the phone but does not allow one to get rid of the air bubbles because it does not seal very tight. i love this phone so far. it's nice and big enough for my needs. i am also happy with my battery life. the only complaint i have is that some of the games that i love like Angry birds star wars 2 is refusing to install on my phone. I don't know why. Is it only my phone or is it all galaxy s 5? or is it just the unlocked version? I have no idea. the phone is very pricey if you buy the unlocked version like me. Carrier branded versions are much cheaper but they are bloated with carrier junk apps that you cannot uninstall unless root it. This is the best mouse ever, I absolutely love it! I'm not very techno savvy so I was afraid it would be too complicated but it is very simple to install and use. There are a lot of optional settings so if it isn't doing what you want you can probably adjust it. Good tripod for the average user. Very light plastic makes it easy to carry, but suffers on durability. When it is set up with them camera it feels very top heavy. I wouldn't let go of the camera! This is my first tablet. I love the purple backlit keyboard. I also like the bluetooth capabilty, and easy access to my hotmail accounts. I can access my work computer remotely, which is very helpful. I like having a USB port for extra storage or connecing a mouse. I wish there were two USB ports and an HDMI port. Sometimes my cursor gets displaced randomly. Overall, I am very happy with my Surface Pro! I really like this wireless mouse. It makes life easier with my laptop. After I played Lego City Undercover I got really interested in the Lego games and while this game is not as great as that one it is still a fun game. If you like the Lego video games then you will like this as it has a lot of the same fun and comedy that Lego games are known for. Wish that they would have put more gamepad features into this as Lego City Undercover did that beautifully but sadly the other Lego games have been lacking in that area. name brand, lite weight, easy to install. real cold air Overall this is an awesome case. I have had a few people say it sounded like I was in a tunnel when talking to them, but a majority of the time it has not been an issue. Picture card holds hundreds of pictures and the quality of the pictures are great. I installed the tv in an apartment community fitness center. Great size and easy setup. Since receving my Roku I have enjoyed the number of listings it provides. Go get it right now.. it will change your life. Granted I upgraded from an S3 but I have owned every single iPhone there was at some point either directly or through my wife. Love our machine, you can see the dirt wash away, Love the drying feature, you can see the difference in your floor from a regular steam mop.\n",
        "Good for different surfaces. Great game that reminds me a little of the GTA series. Open world to explore with little side missions to complete at your leisure. I have been using a KVM switch by the same mfg but fitted with PS/2 connectors for several years already and it's a great convenience. I just bought the newest model because I'm upgrading my machines and all will have USB connections for KB and mouse, so I really had to get a new switch. The newer model has all four sets of connections permanently connected to the switch box whereas the old one you could chose to use 2, 3 or 4 sets, so I temporarily tied up two of the sets until I get around to upgrading a 3rd machine. The newer switch also has a small push button switch that toggles you from machine to machine. While it's quick to use, it also seems flimsy and I much prefer the old mechanism where you simply hit the Ctrl key twice to switch to the next PC in sequence. Now I sometimes find myself searching for the tiny KVM switch on my cluttered desk. The new switch simply slows me down when I'm switching back and forth testing programs. With the old mechanism, I was already at the keyboard. I'm also wondering if there will be a shortened life with the new switching switch again because it seems a bit flimsy to me. That aside, it works great, is simple to install and use, and the price has also taken a fall to about 1/3 of what I paid for the PS/2 based KVM switch. So my only complaint really is I'd much prefer to just need the keyboard to switch around. I actually had to create an account in order to review this product. I have tried many fitness bands (bodybugg, fitbit flex, garmin connect) over the last several years. This band in my opinion captures all the best qualities a fitness band can be. I bought the heart rate monitor when I purchased the loop and that makes this band my all time favorite.\n",
        "\n",
        "I tried the garmin connect and thought i would love it but returned it within a couple of days. The loop with the heart rate monitor captured my cycling output like the fitbit could never do. If you want a fitness band and want a more accurate reflection of your burn, i highly recommend the polar loop and the polar heart rate monitor. Love this tv. It's my first flat screen and it took me forever to decide on what make and model. I wish I had purchased the 55inch I had looked at but all in all, I'm very happy! Used this primarily for saving scanned documents.\n",
        "So far it has been reliable, which is a good thing to count on for business travel purposes. Having played all the Mario Kart games Nintendo has made this is the best one yet. Not only is it visually stunning but the new courses are fun and imaginative. The classic courses have been enhanced more than graphically and designed to fit the new game elements. While the online could use a couple enhancements it is fun to play with friends and strangers. If you have ever played a Mario Kart game and enjoyed it then this is a must buy. Its a great movie for the kids they love it! I would highly recommend it to all. Very funny and entertaining. easy to store music and files. movies and pictures I got this switch to use in the office and for the price it was the perfect product. Just picked this tv up to upgrade from a 10 year old crt phillips magnavox and I'm very happy with it. The 249.99 price was just too good to pass up and the 720p resolution actually looked better than the 1080p on the models in the store. Set up was a breeze and even without a HD cable box the picture is beautiful. The only negative I found was the sound quality, it's okay but on a tv this size you would expect a better sound. I would definitely buy this brand again. just what we needed to watch movies wirelessly from our laptops great Tv we have it in our sun room and it is easy to use This filter will help you to protect your lens from scratches stylish, great sound, comfortable to wear for hours I will buy it again. It lasted a lot longer than I expected. The quality was good. I would recomend this product to my coworkers. I would like to see more specials involving this product. Purchased this item so I could run CD's and DVD's on my mac pro air. Easy to connect and use. Fits nicely into my laptop caring case with the laptop. I've missed the WWII battlefield. This game helped scratch that itch. The Wireless shutter release is good to have when you want to take a photo with a tripod. So this product ti the ideal one to have It always works and is durable. It's annoying to have to buy them (I must have a dozen 30 pin cables) and to have to pay so much, but as the wirecutter site notes, it's the best you can buy. great computer at a great price and it is a Dell and 8gb of ram is really speedy and great for multitasking Purchased this last minute for a long distance ride in an older car. The converter worked great. No hiss, no noise, it just let us listen to our music. I intended to return it after the trip but will keep it. I am a gamer and I like to play mp sometimes, and I get to watch movies and such The HP951 cartridge gets me the most for my money. I used to change cartridges what seemed like once a month and now the cartridge last several months. With the bright color easy to find in my purse. Stay in my ear well. Like the fit in my ear. Nice sound too. The fan is quiet and plenty of cables to hook up almost anything. Wife had the original Ipad and finally went out. she loves the speed and ease of all features apple has to offer. this is a great washing machine lots of room the controls are awesome features are more than you need my wife says it's perfect Compact disc full of very good songs.Only one stinker on it. Loved it. it is easy to down load stuff from your computer. like it is easy to put in the computer. The graphics card was priced right and works well. In general, the ipad is great for computer novices. But not having the ability to add more storage is a big negative. Great strings for a beginner like my son. They sound great... I was hoping for a clearer picture. But for now it fits my needs. Works as expected but thought it was a bit pricey. Would expect a \"dongle\" to be less than $20. it is easy to put in you camera. like it because you can put a lot of pictures on it. compact,easy to set-up, Great sound, just wish the range was farther. Plugged in and set up. It worked right away and looked great I was skeptical when it came to electrical shavers. Purchasing this bad boy has forever changed my view. It gets so close to the skin it's equivalent to razor shaving (and without ever pinching/cutting your skin), it comes with a precision trimmer already attached, AND it cleans its-freaking-self... Stop looking and just buy it. In my opinion, it only has one downfall; the plug itself sticks out pretty far from the wall. I just unplug when it's not washing its-freaking-self and the battery is fully charged. Oh, it also comes with a nice protective travel case. It works very quickly compared to our last router. Although the computer screen displayed that the cartridge was non conforming it operated well and did a good job with the print output. My husband owns the original one and I've wanted one for myself for a long time now. I'm visiting my daughter in Cali and figured this was the time to go for it!! I actually enjoyed my plane ride this time around with my new toy lol! Worked great for a few weeks then suddenly lost its settings. Excellent for music, easy to use. Good capacity, good sound. My husband love it over all it is a good gps.it help me fine different places. this is a very good product for the money and quality It was simple enough to set up and I love the kid-safe browsing. It screens pretty well. For $100, it is a great first tablet. My 12 yr olds even play with it when their tablets die...so it is also compatible with older kids as well...especially clumsy ones...lol. Im using this battery backup for my computer and other electronics. It does what its suppose to do. Im just hoping it will remain functional for a long time. Happy to have this piece of useful hardware. Can't believe how great the sound is coming from this sound bar. It fills the room! Easy to connect and the subwoofer is awesome. Love the bluetooth connection from my iPad to play music.. Minor flaw is the Remote, the volume buttons aren't different from the others and hard to find in the dark. Love the ARC feature... The phone is easy to use and the free apps are numerous.\n",
        "A great pocket computer with a phone and camera. Fair price and easy to replace old cartridge. Good print quality. Got back to printing work quickly. Best book/movie series ever. Several of my coworkers are listening to the audio books and watching the movies. Muckying about a city? Causing havock? Antiheroes?! Yes, please.  This is our third Vizio. Great TV for the price. We will get another. However, I never use just one product- I always run some kind of spyware system also... seems like no matter who or what I use... what one misses the other one catches. I have tried many things to help me lose weight, this thing just works for me. Keeping track of meals, having daily goals that are easy to track just make it great. I use this everyday and knock on wood \"it still works . The case saved the phone from a drop out of my pocket on to a ceramic tile when sitting. This affordable and functional mouse was a real bargain. It is responsive and handles nicely. I recommend it for general use! Charging and battery life fast &amp; long, like that you can save data by selecting wifi instead of cellular for emails. These work ok though not quite as reliable as Verbatim. Out of 100 I usually average 3 coasters. I use them to back up data and burn an occasional video DVD from my camcorder. I bought this today and it has nice sound. Anything was an improvement over the speakers in the TV. Watching a movie, I jumped when the sound suddenly increased at one point in the movie. It took a while to figure out since I bought it as an open box item and it did not have a manual. Luckily I found the manual online. Once I got it set up it was great. Not the best, but not the worst either. If you don't have a smart TV, and your thinking about getting one, consider buying this instead. You can save a ton of money to do most of the things your going to want your smart TV to do. Plays better on the PC but if you don't have one it will do. First time buying a HDMI cable. Good price, easy to use and good quality. This is the most beautiful picture I have ever seen on a tv! It's super sharp and the colors are beautiful. We used the ARC to connect to the sound bar and satellite box, it works perfectly. We love the usb connected flash drive with photos that rotate while the tv is off. I enjoy this laptop. I use it school and all of my work needs. I have not had any issues so far that is why i am giving such a high rating. I have been going back and forth regarding purchasing a 4K television since they first came out. I was having a difficult time deciding between this TV and the 2014 Samsung 55-inch 4K. I decided to spend the $500.00 extra and got this one. I upgraded from an old Panasonic plasma.\n",

        "WOW! That about sums it up! The picture is unbelievable! Luckily, I have a 7.1 surround system and receiver. I tested out the 3D with one of my sons Disney movies and WOW! INCREDIBLE! My sofa is at least 18 feet from the TV and the 3D still looks amazing (granted the closer you get the better it looks). But still!\n",

        "I will be adding a 4K DVD player (Sony) and a 4K ready receiver. If you thought about getting one of these and have the extra money, get the Sony. It is definitely worth every penny of it! I used this kit to install a Kenwood DDX471HD in my 2012 Impala. I initially used a Scoshe kit but I wasn't happy with the finish, this one is a much better match to the factory dash. This kit was also less expensive! If you like the first one on ps3 you will like this one. pretty cool movie with good visuals and a add on to the classic story.\n",

        "greek myths are the best stories= Well after a break in we lost laptops &amp; Ipod. Since my wife is partial to the classic. We had to get the same one. Good storage for lots of songs! Very durable compared to a ipod touch. Easy and fast to use set up. 3D is perfect. Picture quality is great The most accurate monitor I have ever used. The Fitbit community is also extensive &amp; motivating. This is my first smartphone and I really love it. I really don't need a computer anymore (I'm not really attached to new technology) however, I can check my emails, facebook and other important accounts right from my phone. Love the music part of it (Pandora, etc.) Great phone! works as intended. only bought it because higher capacities weren't available. Assassins Creed, Far Cry and Skyrim thrown into Grand Theft Auto. After researching several different products that help track \"fitness\", I decided on the FitBit because the others tracked things that I was not really concerned with. I mostly wanted something that would keep track of my steps/miles per day. The FitBit is easy to use and if you want to keep up the daily logs, can also help you with eat, sleep and other patterns. entered the code online, got $50 credit. can't ask for more VERY HELPFUL WITH INFORMATION THAT MADE MY CHOICE EASY. Love the iPad Air, great for people who find the older models to be bulky and heavy for using at extended periods of time! I use these everyday when I can my dog for his walk. I just purchased the Samsung Galaxy 5s phone and it works well with it. I had wanted a new camera and this was a birthday gift. I immediately started reading the book, and watching the video. I used it to shoot some sunsets and the pictures were pretty amazing! Then I took some pictures of my two pit bulls - again, the quality of the pictures were absolutely awesome! It appears to be easy to use, but I know there is so much more the camera will do, so I am still learning about the different features. I know I will enjoy this camera. The performance rating from manufacturer appears to be accurate and not overstated. Pleased with purchase and would recommend to others. Sync's we'll with Galaxy S5 to show incoming calls and texts. Had difficulty with iPhone. Accurate tracking. LG app (free) was easy to download to my devices and sync. Able to view progress on band and/or phone/device. Can wear band on either hand. Scrolling is easy to track progress. I really like NBA 2K14 overall. It is fun to play especially with other people. It does have glitches and passing can still be hit and miss. I have recently updated my phone to the Samsung Galaxy 5s and this Belkin - EaseFit Plus Armband Case for Samsung Galaxy S III Cell Phone does fit the Galaxy 5s. I can also carry a key for my car so I can lock it when I go for walks in town. This is what you would expect- Word, Excel, Powerpoint and Outlook... I have used them for years and worth the money... I love this and depend on it daily. I have learned a lot about my sleeping habits. I have to get better on tracking and exercising This was suppose to be a plug and play device. I followed the directions and the first thing that happened was that the name on my router changed. None of my wireless devices would work. I had to log onto the router and change the name back to the original name. It took about four tries to get the extender setup and I am a fairly advanced user. Once I got it setup it works as advertised. Have had 2 of these in a previous model and loved them though their motors burned out. Bought this new model and it is easier to use than ever and so far so good with the motors. It is worth it. Keeps my floors sparkling with so little effort. Decent buy for the price. Call quality is good enough, caller ID is nice too. Bought for nephews and they loved it, highly recommended. Iwill buy it again as it works very well, just sort of expensive. This case is perfect for the Microsoft Surface. It fits perfectly and has enough padding to protect it without being bulky. It's great for travel and has a zippered pocket for extras. Will buy again. I installed the tv in a small grocery store. The picture quality and sound is good. I love this printer so far. It was easy to set up. Print quality also good and prints pretty fast. I Wish the price was cheaper good value and would buy again. no surprises and product delivers overall i would give this product a great rewiew!! This is my first Call of Duty game. I'm not real good at these combat games and my gameplay suffers because of this. I bought this game because it resembles Crysis 3 and I enjoyed the story in that one. This game has a somewhat believable plot in that another country decides to invade The United States. I have avoided the Call of Duty and Battlefield games because of the similarity to modern day warfare. The graphics in this game are simply outstanding, even on my Xbox 360. It just might convince me to buy an Xbox One just to experience this game in all it's splendor. If you like a good plot and beautiful graphics, this game is for you. Top sound. Nice fold up structure. Fits over the ear. Can't say much here.....hooked like no music form female artist has done before!!!! I gave this movie a 4 out 5 because I really would of like to see other hidden character in the movie that also part of a secret life that we normal humans don't see. Price was great. HDMI cable was easy to install and works great. Great product. Great value. The sound is much better than I anticipated. I could watch this over and over again! They shouldn't stop making seasons... The best animation series in my collection! I would recommend this product because the price can't be beat. The touchpad controls are excellent and it makes you want more! This wireless base station is everything I wanted. I can connect my non-wireless printer in it and make it wireless! This far better than the older apple base station I had. I'm loving it!!! I am not the most tech savy. I hooked this up in no time. Too easy. This is the 4th Sonos unit we have purchased. All are wonderful and work great. When you find something that works well, you don't want to change. This product works well, and I have been very pleased with its performance. This is a good device for commuters with passengers as it had a separate USB port to connect another device for charging. Easy to set up, fast, compact, a must have, fast and reliable burning. easy setup, Works Great for our Office use, wireless unit is really Handy, compact unit makes for ease to place out of way use My daughter wanted to use my more expensive one but I did not want to let her have it to break so this gave me an affordable choice that she totally loves Great speed, easy to set up, large screen is great for photo editing. This is my first camera purchase in a very long time, I liked the Nikon because it gives me the option for wifi to send the pictures directly to my phone so I can upload them onto Social sites, etc. I am excited :) I bought this for my granddaughter's 8th birthday and she love it. She is reading all the time, which is a good thing. Bought this item after i lost yet another pair of earbuds...the bright color, fit and sound quality is better then the buds I had before The product saves the screen from daily wear &amp; tear, cuts glare without decreasing brightness of screen. This is by far my favourite show. Every character and story arc are so fleshed out it speaks volumes for the quality. Very small design, purchased this to plug it into my car's USB port. Best picture and sound. Best house held name. Best purchase of 2014 Really great movie. The directing and acting are all top notch. This a surprise movie. It has a lot of heart, more than you would expect for a movie about fighting robots. I am very happy with the SanDisck memory card so far. :) I enjoyed this movie. It kept going without dragging. Quickly introduced the characters enough to be able to pick your favorites. The end was pretty predictable but still good none the less. This cord is just basic and what I need to get my PC back up and running. The old cord just gave out. I was surprised that this cord is able to be purchased by itself and not as a 'set' of anything. This is the best star trek film that's not about star trek. It hits all the right notes and the cast is phenomenal in all their roles. Definitely the best quality TV on the market. If you are looking for a 70 inch TV with all the bells and whistles and high quality to go with it, then look no further! After a lot of market research this TV easily beats the competition and is definitely a great investment. Great router. Speedtest is hitting my full 50mgbs service were it used to hit 20 on wireless. 1 reset after month online This monitor was reasonably priced. It was easy to hook it up to the PC tower and the color was wonderful. Bought game..usually get gamefly but reviews and length were good on this game didnt disappoint The controller works great. I really like the black and the buttons feel natural. It's a sleek design. I love the series and this game is no different but the story line is not long enough Very slim and sleek product, easy to store. Great burner for the money. Good buy It is an easy camera to use. The problem is the pictures are fuzzy and if some one moves at all the picture is blurry. It would be an excellent price if not for the picture quality. This is great for the Nikon D5200. And it is one of the best cameras period. I have heard from others that it actually takes a better picture ( filter )\n",

        "I have tested side by side far superior pic then a 5300 or my D7100\n",
        "\n",
        "But that makes since I also prefer my D7000 to my D7100. So you better get this tool before it's gone\n",
        "\n",
        "The bronze d5200 is very hard to find since it is in so much demand I'd buy it for every phone I get. It's a bit expensive but worth it. great filter a little overpriced though geeeeeez its a water filter what else can I say. that's my review Loved this show. Big fan of Gary Sinise. Sorry to see the series end. So far it has been a great phone. It was hard to move away from the Samsung line, but so far seems to be as good in quality. I love this movie and it looks great on my Sony KDL55W900A. Love this family. Si and jace are my favorites on this show Love this cover. Plan to get it in more colors. I have arthritis, and I can hold my phone easely with this cover. Very flavorful coffee. Tastes great without having to add anything to it. No need for flavored creamers with this stuff. hands down Tech21 are the Best cases for all your electronic protection. It's a must have if you love your toys and want Superior protection without the heavy and big cases like the others on the market. I can not tell you how many times Tech21 has saved my phones and tablets from breaking. once you try it, you will never buy any other brand. The Xl ink is great, don't have to buy ink frequently. This is my first smart phone, I love it. I can do so much with it. Keep track of everything and everyone. I've been playing Mario Kart since before Mario Kart was a thing. I've owned every single one of the 7 previous entries at one time or another, and I can tell you right here and now, that this is the best Mario Kart game in MANY YEARS, definitely since the N64 and one could argue is the greatest entry of all time. Let me explain why I feel the way that I do.\n",
        "\n",
        "For one, the gameplay is finally balanced to the point it's no longer a bashfest during races. There are now 12 racers instead of the traditional 8, so you'd logically think that would mean more items flying around, but that's not the case. Nintendo has eliminated the \"item bullpen\" so that players can now ONLY have one item in hand at any given time. This was how the original Mario Kart was balanced, and now, in the 8th iteration, we see a return to form. It's still crazy enough to be fun, but no so extreme that it ruins it for skill-based competition.\n",
        "\n",
        "Second, the game looks gorgeous. This is the first time Mario Kart has ever been seen in full high definition, and it doesn't disappoint. Idk what else to say- it looks great. The framerate is locked at 60fps (unless playing 3/4 player split screen- then it's locked at 30fps), so it's all very smooth play from start to finish.\n",
        "\n",
        "Third, let's get to the video replay integration. The game automatically stores recent races in the Mario Kart TV hub, allowing you to view, edit and upload to Miiverse and You Tube at any time. You can also view highlight reels after every race, as well as edit them by dictating which characters to focus on, what type of action, what kind of sound effects, and how long it should be. You can then post the video directly to the Mario Kart 8 community in Miiverse, as well as Youtube (requires a Google Plus Account). The Miiverse uploads will be displayed as embedded YouTube videos with the option of viewing in normal or high quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fourth, the characters, bikes, and customizations are terrific. The entirety of the Koopalings cast makes their first appearance, and adds quite a bit of spice to the roster. I find myself playing with Iggy, Roy and Ludwig almost every race, with a Bower kite as my glider parachute. They're colorul, they're fun, and they're one of THE greatest roster additions to Mario Kart I've ever seen. Just surprised it took 8 games to finally include them! Better late than never, I suppose.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fifth, the controller options are many. No matter how you like to kart, this game has you covered. Like traditional analogues but want the benefit of having a map off-screen to check? Gamepad has you covered. Want to play off-TV while in another room or while watching something else on TV? Gamepad has you covered. Want to feel immersed in the race with motion? Again, gamepad has you covered. Alternatively, you can use a Wiimote and pop it in a Wii Wheel. Like the lightweight feel of a normal controller? Pro Controller it is, then. Used to the standard Wii controls without motion? That's cool- just use a Wiimote and Nunchuk. Oh, you like normal controllers but don't own a Pro Controller? Not to worry- you can still use the Classic Controller Pro plugged into a Wiimote. What can I say- I LOVE the diverse controller options!\n",
        "\n",
        "Most importantly, the game is fun. And I do mean FUN. The tracks are spectacular with anti-gravity (not to mention just PACKED with detail), there's new mechanics like anti-gravity boosts, proper drifting for bikes and ATVs, stunt boosts make a return, and the drifting mechanics can vary widely depending on character, bike and wheels. The game is perfectly balanced in every way, and the courses are well designed with shortcuts and branching pathways.\n",
        "\n",
        "All in all, this is the finest Mario Kart game I've played since I was a young teenager. The ONLY reason I would perhaps not rate this over Mario Kart 64, is how impactful and innovative that game was for it's time. Compared side by side though, it's not even a competition. Mario Kart 8 wins hands down and blindfolded. It's just superior in every way. In every respect.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mario Kart 8 is not only good enough that I recommend buying the game (if you own a Wii U, there is ZERO reason to not have this game in your system right now), it's good enough that I daresay it's worth buying a Wii U for all on it's own. Well why is that, you ask? It's not that this is the first great Wii U game, because it's not (Pikmin 3, Super Mario 3D World, Wonderful 101, Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze, Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate, Wii Sports Club, etc...) It's just that this is the first great Wii U game that has indefinite replay value. I'll be playing this game for YEARS to come. YEARS. I may even still be playing it when the next generation of consoles come around. Such is the longevity of Mario Kart. Buy this game. excellent option for mounting TVs to the wall. tilting is a going option to get the best viewing angle. also allows for easier access to cables on the back of the TV. I still have a dvd recorder and love taking home movies of my family, putting the movies on these dvds and mailing them to family that is out of state. Also the are great keepsakes too.  Possibly the best of the \"Fast\" series. Great action and a great plan pulled off flawlessly!! Great protection without adding a lot of bulk (size and weight) to the phone. This simple product should be able to work for most needs from people. The sound quality seems to be good right now as it is new. The length for the price is decent. It doesn't seem to damage the iPhone jack. I guess the physical quality isn't too bad for the price. I would suggest people buy it if you are not looking for a fancy look like the other expensive ones that people are buying for the same feature, but just with better looks. Hunt and Paxton are great together as the busted up couple with one common passion! Chasing Tornados!! This phone is great for me i was going to buy samsung galaxy s3 from verizon prepaid for $350!! and this phone is only $100 with better performance then s3. The thing that i dont like is the camera but still $100 for this phone is worth it :). I'd buy this again. Helps keep my phone and headset charged up when I'm away from home. After getting a new entertainment cabinet we had to purchase a longer cable to connect our receiver to our DVR. So far this works great with no problems. This is what the sales person suggested I should buy and so far it works great. My old modem died and didn't want to spend a lot of money to replace it so went with this one. It was fairly east to install once I got the needed info from my internet provider. We got this tv because it was big and priced comparable to smaller dumb tvs. Beautiful picture and smart tv features are easy to use and set up. If you have Samsung phones/tablets you can even share music, photos, and videos to the tv. I think the computer can also connect, but not sure how.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bad stuff? There was the screen dimming \"feature\" that took a little searching to turn off, and I guess I wouldn't mind an extra hdmi (has 3) but I'm nitpicking now Stainless steel looks modern and sleek. Easy to use. Cooks evenly and quickly. The constant on defrost setting works much better than other microwaves which cycle on and off. I'm just the average consumer with a sharp eye for picture quality. If you want great picture with a great design this is for you! Speakers are not great, but who buys a monitor for sound quality? Could of done without them for a better product and possible more slim design. It 's good to have the option to access high end phones on Virgin Mobile. Easy to carry in my purse if I'm not in my own car. Easy to use. I have played most all the Kirby games. This one is very cute and seems somewhat easier than prior ones, until you get to the last level,\n",
        "The graphics are awesome, especially in the 3D platform.\n",
        "you will not be disappointed with this game. I ended up purchasing the 70in and I have to say I'm very pleased with my decision. The TV was a breeze to setup and with 16mil pixels the picture is so clear it's like looking out a window. Can't wait to try the 3D!! If you ever wanted an open world game with hacking involved, then this is the game for you. I love it and definitely recommend it. Worth the purchase!Worth the purchase!Worth the purchase! Twists and turns galore in this fast paced shoot 'em up!\n",
        "Absolutely loved it!! Got this for my son in his first apartment , what a deal! I like this model because you can fine tune it , we actually ended up with a setting with fewer channels but the ones that he would watch which is what is important . Pair it up with an internet based tv if you can and you will have all you need I like it because I can buy a certain amount instead of a company telling me how much to buy. There's different price ranging from 10 dollars &amp; up. I wanted to buy a movie &amp; download a game or a map pack. The 10.00 playstation store card bought me exactly what I wanted with out me spending much than I needed. Great product, stylish and durable. Offers good protection to your phone. User firendly music receiver. Small. Good autonomy This is a great set for the Star Wars fan. I was hoping they would bring the original IV, V and VI out in Blu-Ray without all the extra scenes added, but who knows when that will be. extremely easy to install, if you have never done anything like it. H. Jon Benjamin and the other voice actors are the ones that really make this show great. The quality and design of this mount makes it we'll worth the money. Much sturdier than my previous mount. Loved the flexibility to adjust it in a lot of different ways. It doesn't shake like my last one. This scree protector is great. I dropped my phone a number of times and no damage was sustained to the screen. This was bought to put my tv on the wall it was easy to mount and holds the plasma tv with out any problem even with it being heavier than an LCD TV. ordered this but it took 2 weeks to get here because of the stupid mailman sent it to the wrong state i got this for my house and it works really good. its awesome for partys My first touch screen and I love it! It has excellent color (good picture quality). I am enjoying the speed of this computer. I bought this album so I can get rid of their entire back catalog of music. This two disc set is a great summary of their 40 year career. 1 track off of each album along with some unreleased live tracks and rarities. From the self-titled album to their recent studio album Monster. This'll probably be the last KISS album I'll ever purchase. Monitor has great resolution for a great price. The vivid colors made it easier to look at for longer periods of time. Its nice to be able to hang my tv on the wall instead of just the dresser for more room and to be higher for laying down. I really liked the game, it wasn't 100% to my expectations because I thought I would have been more sucked to the game than I am but it's still a really good game. I would be more sucked into it if I played more main missions but they have so much extra side missions. if you're a fan of the southern blues, you'll love this I use this to download movies. Works great for what I use it for. great movie and finally the directors cut fits all on one disc not as many mini docs and other special features as the dvd counter part though I love my new 70\" Sharp TV. The model I bought is the 70UQ17U and I am truly amazed on how great of a TV it is. Has nice vibrant colors and great picture quality ! This was the first game I have played of the Infamous series. Hoping for another one in years to come. Its nice to have it so that way I dont law have to watch the same thing as what someone else is watching in the living room. one of the best super hero movies out there I'm not a fan of super man at all and i loved this movie Bought this as a birthday gift for my father to get movies off his DVR and onto disc. The picture quality is so crisp and clear. Will def buy these once he runs out again. I don't give it a 5 star because when I called costumer support on a setting up issue they were more lost them me about product knowledge. Something that I though could be impossible. I was actually able to figure the issue out BUT no thanks to them, I play with it until I found the solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "What was the issue? I wanted to sync the sound bar to the TV so, when using ONE remote (the TV's), it would control both the TV's and the sound bar's sound. According to Samsung costumer support, this is impossible because the TV is too new and there aren't any driver for it. NOT TRUE. All you have to do is make sure the setting on the sound bar is to TV, then go to the TV's menu, click on audio, speaker settings, TV sound, and set it to \"sound share\". The sound bar setting when initially installed, for some unknown reason, was under AUX in setting thus the \"sound share\" feature in the menu would be grayed out. The Samsung people did not know this, UNREAL!!!!! I strictly use this for my car and its fantastic. I dont need the features of an ipod touch. Space is much more important to me. I like to use uncompressed music and the size limitations of an Ipod touch make this the smarter buy for me. I can have 40 gigs of uncompressed music with loads more space to spare. I hope apple doesnt discontinue this product as its more sensible for some people who also own an Iphone. A solid phone. I suspect power users will find the HTC One more than up to the task. Newbies, like me, will appreciate the ease of use and long batter life.\n",
        "\n",
        "Can't go wrong with this phone! This wasn't a bad first buy. Buying this TV was my first TV I bought for myself and it was well worth the buy. The picture on this screen is actually good and doesn't have any other issues since buying it. I'm overall satisfied with this purchase I needed this to help restore a blown drive on another PC. This unit booted up and worked as needed. Fun movie, I laughed, happy to own it. I recommend it. Watch Dogs is a very fun, entertaining game. Ubisoft does a good job of blending key components from some of their more popular titles into one very enticing game. The only problem I have with it is the lack of an open world multiplayer. Recommended. Fun movie, I laughed, happy to own it. I recommend it. Love milk chocolate before going to bed. Taste good and also very convenient to make. solid funny movie for anyone who is a fan of will ferral This is my second chromecast, I like having the whole house wired. Fun movie, I laughed, happy to own it. I recommend it. If you have liked Chevelle's other albums, you will like this one. They really haven't changed their style much over the years, and that's no exception here. I must say, while I like their music, some variation from album to album might be nice. The back half of this album feels less exciting for 2 reasons. First, there are 2 slower songs, which is fine if you are into that. Second, I also feel as though the back end is also less original, recycling some of their older ideas (as I mentioned before). Overall, a good album. Good sound, but it doesn't synch up well with all programs like it should. Excellent adapter for connect your MacBook with a cable for Lan or internet. Fun movie, I laughed, happy to own it. I recommend it. Great functions, ease of use, all in one, compact, great look! Bought this to replace a failed unit. This installed easily and was a good value. Fun movie, I laughed, happy to own it. I recommend it. Best coffee next to store bought Starbucks. And at the covenience of your own home. works perfectly no setup needed just point at xbox and go , perfect option for anyone who uses their xboxone as a blu-ray player and doesn't like using a controller , its light weight and intuitive and all buttons illuminate so no fumbling in the dark This product has made my workout enjoyable in the gym. I purchased this computer for school work and it has been amazing! I have it in my bedroom and use it as a TV when I want to watch movies at night. It's big enough and has a great sound quality so it works perfectly for that. The touchscreen is amazing and very easy to use. Sensitive enough but not overly sensitive. All around a great computer! This game is bringing back our childhood. great game recreated for the child in all of us. I love this product. Have recomended it to several friends. will buy them as gifts at Christmas. Great game overall well done by ubisoft , would definitely recommend to anyone I previously purchased a Sonos Playbar to use with my TV and have been very pleased with the sound and flexibility of that unit. We recently converted a screened porch into a sunroom and wanted a simple way to enjoy Pandora, Sirius and local radio in the sunroom, so we decided to add a Play:1 to our Sonos setup. The sound is great, especially for a unit so small; it easily fills the room. The ability to select music and control volume with iPhones, iPad or laptop makes everything convenient. We're very pleased with the purchase and will happily buy Sonos again. Cost a little more than I would like to pay for a non-durable good but they work well and don't leave streaks on my TV's or computer monitor. I love these earbuds. The quality is great. I broke my first pair while I was biking and immediately purchased new ones. Love the laptop and the price was great, but I am not a fan of the windows 8. The touchscreen is amazing, but I believe that if I learn Windows 8 a little more then I will be ok. I love the Beatsaudio it sounds awesome! watching movies and videos is heaven :). I have an HDMI cable built into my wall and needed another one to reach to my new tv so I bought this double female connector. It works great for streaming movies on my laptop and watching tv from my Xbox but the one problem I have with it is latency, I can tell the different between just 1 HDMI cable and using these 2 cables connected when playing Xbox live games and there is a little lag between when I move the joystick on the controller and when I see it move on the TV. Good game to try haven't tried it yet but looks very exciting, heard there were some issues but hope it's still worthwile It's a really nice little motivator! I can track my sleep, and steps. I wish there was directions with it to set your stride, it is short changing me on miles (I use map my walk with gps and my fitbit is always less than map my walk is, by about a mile.). It is still nice to give me at least an idea of what I am doing and how active I am on different days. I like the larger ink cartridge because it last longer. Good TV for the price. I would have preferred better sound. overall a good TV for the price. The 3D feature is a plus, given that most models are now offering it as an add-on. The Zelda saga continues to be as adventurous as previous games. Always a great past time...never knowing what you will find. As usual, Zelda is great for all ages. It is so nice to have a laptop with a touchscreen and the convenience of a tablet when I just want to play games. I can do all my work so much fatter with the 16 gigs of RAM. The virtual keyboard is a little bit and doors get in the way if you really want to get work done. Really cool game with great graphics. I only have one complaint and that would be that the characters mouth is off with the voice. Otherwise it has a cool GTA / LA Noire feel but with hacks. I use it to back up data on my tablet, Almost forgot it was even there! A family guy takes his wife and kids to Disneyland...only to discover that he's lost his job. So, he becomes delusional and begins having hallucinations. This is the movie that Walt Disney doesn't want you to see! the case is strong but not too big I like the color and feel. Had performed quite a bit of research to decide whether to go with Windows 7 or Windows 8. Glad that I went this way other than the issue with Windows Mail files not being easily imported into Outlook, the install went very smoothly. didn't try to burn anything yet, but downloaded about 100 cd's to iTunes.\n",
        "Didn't recognize only one copied cd, even though there were other cd's of same manufacturer. sometimes the sound coming from it sounded like it was dying but then its normal. so far so good. I love this headset! Makes playing games so much better! I like the ease of installing this product. I enjoy using the color cartridges. A mix of GTA, Far Cry and Assassin's Creed with today's technology. Potential to be the next great franchise. Easy to use. Nothing to it. Plugged it in and it worked fine. Bought this system because I saw the original Zelda was available to download. The e store offers a lot of long past games. The ease of using this system is incredible. I think it is a great product for the price. I have enjoyed using it. It is a great game graphics are spectacular and the game play is challenging and fun Easy to use, if your not familiar with it, a lot to learn as well. I am not a fan of Sylvester Stallone but this was a pretty decent movie. You must read the instructions two times to wall mount it. Otherwise works great It's a good all around pc, fast and easy to use. I hope this helps someone. Look forward to downloading movies. Easy to set up. This keyboard was easy to connect right out of the box. Nothing extra needed and have not had any glitches. Was a little pricey but nice to have a external keyboard for business.  Love everything about it. Thanks. This is a great product. There are many offerings for channels. A little expensive, but great for any computer! I would buy again! the drive is fast and my backups are quick. Really like that part of it. The cost was great, seems easy to use, etc. I could not find a way to control volume from tv when connected with optical cable. Great product would definitly buy again if goes bad. Sounds great with little parts, wireless sub hid behind couch don't even see it and can hear clearly. Music sounds awsome without dropping a grand on Bose. Great value for the money. I was looking at other Rocketfish cables that were really expensive when a gentleman told me that these were on sale for a great price in the gamer section of the store. So I bought this cable and am glad I did,works great for my application. Is a respected product name and got it at a great price Hard to find a case for your 2DS, so this is pretty much your only choice. Pick red or pick blue, but at least you have a case that fits! I've had this printer for a few months now and it seems to be working quite well. Haven't had any problems with it. It was easy to set up. I really like The Crew because of the chemistry amongst its lead actors - 4 Stars I would give it. Mafia is a hit-or-miss comedy when it comes to its jokes, but overall a decent film - 3 Stars. This is a good but not great case. The exterior finish feels very premium to the touch with enought tack to it so that it is not slippery. The case looks good and the kickstand is very solid. My case is black which is great for most people however I guess I would like it to come in a clear skin so that I could see the finish of my phone which is beautiful. I feel like I have put a sack on a supermodel. One more problem is that the top and bottom halves of the case don't quite fit together solidly, there is a slight movement to the bottom half which can be disconcerting at times. Other than that it protects my phone as intended. A good value, easy to set up and use right away. Light weight too! Good overall, but not a smart tv. Would be great yo have cable and netflix without all the hassle Really great game that emphasizes hacking an entire city's wireless infrastructure over mindless shooting. Definitely, a must-buy if you like open-world exploration games, though the multiplayer portion could be better. Graphics - 4, Sound - 5, Gameplay - 5, Multiplayer - 3, Fun Factor - 4.\n",
        "21/5 = 4.2 Rating. If you got hooked on season one, you must buy all the rest of the seasons of this show. It's wonderful! The cast is excellent. Great earphones.\n",
        "Fit snugly.\n",
        "Good sound quality\n",
        "No complaints !!! Asus recommended by a friend. He was right, so far no issues of any kind. Quality machine. Husband sent as surprise. Has seen it in another store. Very pleased. Only wish it was wireless,otherwise it's a great keyboard. Well made. If you haven't seen this classic comedy film yet, then go get it right away. Vintage Jim Carrey. Great chemistry and banter between Carrey and Jeff Daniels. This is a great series, one of those must see. Start at the beginning and have a marathon! I like to match my TV and components and I am glad I picked this dvd player. It does not take up a lot of room but yet the quality of the player is big. Great play back of movies and internet features. Thanks Sony for another great product. I have for a long time bought Sony products and am glad I have. I just plug in the cable from the comcast modem and then plug in the nighthawk to the wall electric plug and within a second you get all the wifi signals without any other programming or set up as required in the other routers. This is a fabulous series, if you've never seen it, you should! Its funny, but also has an underlying plot- which unfolds a little more each year. Lots of good twists and turns- and the relationship between Castle and Beckett is always good! This tablet is great for business. Love the stylist feature. Can take notes in hand writing and then have them transferred to a word doc without having to do anything. So many more great features can't even go over all of them. Good movie, my daughter loved it. There was a lot of singing. its a great game for serious gamers really really great easy to use, recharge; and you get to choose yoir area code! This movie pays homage to the Vietnam War films of the 80's. Great acting from the cast and good cameos. Location filming is a major plus. The jokes are well-written, but the casual viewer may not understand the gist of them all. I highly recommend this film if you like to laugh out loud and can appreciate a good popcorn flick. I love my Apple TV! It's easy to setup and easy to use. Nice case. I like that I can turn it different ways to let it stand. ac has great temp settings, keeps room cool in summer and warm for winter. This is probably one of the Hank's best movies, he does like 5 different characters in the movie, plus the story is amazing, I will totally recommend this movie. The set up was difficult with the WiFi instructions. They referred to buttons on the router that mine doesn't have. Had to call the Geek guys for help! Also very noisy. This cord work much better than the traditional gaming console cord. The picture and sound quality was also improved. this game is addictive. I can play it all day and night I had a dyson vacuum and this one tops it! The shark is a lot lighter and it has a lot better suction than the dyson. This is a great camera. great pictures and awesome features. the wifi feature is great when at home for picture sharing. This is the first tablet in my household, and we couldn't be happier. It does everything we expected and more. I've never been a fan of a laptop, as I find them much harder to use than a desktop for most tasks, and I don't have a need for extreme portability for hardcore work. Great case. Super clear and hugs snugly to the iPod. doze not absorb too much ink;good shine on pictures I enjoy the Mentalist as it has a different theme. I enjoy that it teaches one to pay attention to details. will be buying another one soon bought it for my son who just turned 21, who I bought a flat screen from you in December works really well and is easy to install and move around The Desolation of Smaug was captivating and a welcome addition to the collection from the Middle Earth by Peter Jackson. This Blu Ray will fill in the time when TV/Cable has a bad night and programming the DVR isn't worth the time. Very useful product when you hate dealing with wires, but it could use some improvements. It would be great if it had more power on the volume, and also if it had some sort of clip or something to have it cling to your neck when you need it to. I do a lot of dancing so when I'm dancing they tent to fly off my neck, so that's really inconvenient. Would be great if some sort of sade guard was added. This a great convertible laptop. I regularly use it in \"Viewer\" mode and rely on the onscreen keyboard. just upgraded a 2011 panasonic 520 sound bar and connected to my vt60 plasma! the sound is like night and day compared to my old model and the look with my vt60 looks great too. did not want to spend over $400 for a sound bar and this is worth the cost for the sound it puts out! Needed to replace antenna because when windshlld was replaced the technicialn pull too hard on the wire in trying to get it out of the way. New antenna works perfectly and has adapter for my older model. The new anttenna seems to have a more sturdy wire than the original that came with the radio. That may be an improvement XM has made in its design. I noted that the antenna was almost as expensive as buying a new radio that was on sale. Opted to stay with the old which I know the operation of and is mounted where I like it. New radio might not have worked out as well. Cant figure out whether the game ended or what. Other than that it is a good funny game. Improved camera angels I wanted a monopod that was light yet would hold up to moderately heavy use and would accommodate my Nikon D7100. I had looked at a Manfrotto but when I spotted the Sunpak Platinum 6700M monopod I knew I had found the right monopod. Even better, it was on sale!\n",
        "\n",
        "The 6700M extends to 67\" which is perfect for me as I am 6' 1\" so I have \"extra\" room\" if needed for BIF shots. Fully extended it does not flex and when I lean on it the locked legs do not slip. When the non-slip rubber foot is screwed into the lower leg there is a metal spike to help anchor the monopod, if needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sunpak has been in this game for many years and they make a fine product for retired professionals, like myself, or any level of amateur to advanced for a reasonable price. I was looking for something up to date but simple to use for my parents. Plus I've always trusted the Panasonic brand. grate value that got better becuz of 5,000+ points Easy to setup and use. Does everything I needed in a printer. Have used most of the features. I would give it five stars if I could remove threats but its a good product This game is the best motocross/ off road game ever. I've been searching for months but then I found this game and I've never been happier. Purchased to go with my young daughters camera and she loves it. Was an awesome deal. She enjoys taking videos of her crafts and this works perfectly. Bought this iMac a month ago when our desktop PC died. My wife, who's not a techie, has said several times since then, \"Have I told you how much I love our new computer?\" Great speed, graphics, and apps. Don't know why we didn't make the leap earlier.\n",
        "\n",
        "The wireless keyboard that comes with the iMac is a little small if you are used to a full size keyboard. We just plugged our old one into a USB port on the iMac and it works fine. There is no CD or DVD drive built in to this iMac. You will have to buy an external optical drive if you need one. If you are buying a flat screen TV like Samsung 4K, it is really worth it to add this sound bar. It produces the volume and sound effect just like in the movie house. Was purchased for my daughters camera and serves its purpose. Was on sale so even better! Was a gift for my 12 year old and she loves it. Is small and fits in her pocket so she can take anywhere she wants. It took me a few minutes to figure out the zoom feature when she had me take a pic of her and it's an awkward zoom button to me, but she loves it and has no problems. Great price too. The game was a little hyped up but still fun to play. It's like playing GTA mixed with Hackers the movie. I needed a new pc monitor so I decided to buy this tv instead to use as my new monitor. Resolution was great using the vga cable but not so great connecting through the HDMI port. The advantage of using HDMI is that the pc audio goes through the TV. Works great as a TV TOO!!! we bought it at the local store, hooked it up and has worked flawlessly. This adapter allows you to instantly add USB support to your Samsung smartphone. Android operating system automatically detects a mouse or external hard drive. I use the adapter to connect a full size mouse. With a blue tooth keyboard, you can emulate a small \"desktop\" experience. The product comes with my full recommendation. The Griffin Screen Care Kit is a great quality product for any iPod or iPhone with a touchscreen. It's really cheap to purchase &amp; easy to put on. It also stays on really good, so I'd recommend it to anyone. It's worth the money for sure. This second in the series blu-ray release finishes in a flurry of action. The extras were not as good as the first release but I hope the final has more into the back ground of the sets and the their development into the cinema action we see. I bought this kit when installed a new stereo and it fits perfectly, looks nice and has a decent quality. Loved this printer that held the 564 ink cartridges but now it it getting old. Would love to find another that uses 564's. Never had a problem with this ink.. 6 Slots so you can plug in 3 (oversized) to 6 devices.\n",
        "Slot are too close together to have 6 oversized items plugged in. It's easy to to make adjustments on the player. Easy connection to blue tooth. I like our new refrigerator. It has a center drawer for easy access\n",
        "To our daily treats. We can make soda right from dispenser on the door.\n",
        "It has a big ice dispenser and makes good ice cubes. There is\n",
        "Plenty of room for all our food. The led lighting is awesome.\n",
        "I like the controls and display on the outside of the door.\n",
        "The design and construction is very good. The only thing\n",
        "I wish it had was finger proof stainless doors. Mariah never disappoints. R&amp;b meets gospel with a touch of hip hop. As always vocals and collaborations were on point. I have the Zagg screen protector on my phone as well. I like their warranty as if anything happens you can get it replaced and only have to pay for shipping and handling. The cost to replace the ones on the phones are like $3,00 so it is not expensive. Watch Dogs does a great job of recreating Chicago and making it your oyster for hacking the town. There are still a few glitches in the story and online play but overall the game does get the job done. There are some chases that create a very cinematic experience but with such choppy gameplay it can seem a bit undervalued. I used this memory card for a recent 25th Anniversary Trip to the Med. It took great pictures in the Vatican (inside) and of Santorini (outside). This is a fantastic storage device. It is extremely small, lightweight and quite fast. I do like this keyboard, just wish it had backlite keys. It seems to hold a charge for a long time and I have also been able to use this on my smart television as well. This cable looks great and is better than any I have seen. Everyone who sees it asks where I got it and comments on how neat it is. Charges my phone as expected. Very sturdy design. Quality materials. Recommended. You won't be disappointed. I had the Galaxy S4 prior and decided to get this because of some of the features. I simply love Samsung's products alot. This phone is easy to see the screen when you are using the internet, and it is easy to use the keyboard for people like me who have fatter fingers. I am extremely happy with this device. I just wish that they didn't load so many programs on there that I do use or else allow us to uninstall them to remove them. This is a must-purchase 3DS game. The courses are fun and challenging and the online tournaments are great. The user interface is not the best but there are plenty of resources online to help you find the various modes of the game. I needed an easy to use mouse for gaming. This was inexpensive and comfortable to use. I was pleasantly surprised. Tried others and was disappointed. Now back on track. Really awesome and fun good looking graphics and cool physical interactions I found that this stylus was off quality marterial. Easy to hold and write with Not much say other than, it works just as it should! Couldn't be happier. I can't emphasize enough how awesome these headphones are. There are 4 different sizes of earbuds and tips that are included; it wasn't very easy to remove and replace them, but definitely worth it once you find the right size.\n",
        "The earbuds form a perfect seal that really isolates noise. These keep out ambient noise so well that it might be a little dangerous to run outside in heavily trafficked areas, but that same quality makes these perfect for airplane trips. The \"sport clips\" keep the earbuds in place and these are comfortable enough for me to wear for hours at a time without any irritation. But honestly, after all of that, the single best quality about these is the sound; the bass level is perfect for the hip-hop music that I listen to. Just really good headphones, you won't regret buying these.\n",
        "My only negative comment is I would have bought these in a different color if they were available. I don't mind the neon green, but a more conservative color is more my style.. I got this as part of a bundle pack but would have bought it anyway. I have had this virus protection in the past and love it. I have never had any trouble when using Kaspersky. An open world game with lots of things to do. Graphics are excellent but some aspects of control (driving) could be better. Overall I am enjoying the game but I keep getting the feeling more could have been done with this game considering the pre-release hype. Overall will rate it 4/5. I have always been a big fan of Zagg's screen protectors. I have used them on 3 of my devices. They do protect the screen and if something happens and it needs replaced you only have to pay for shipping and handling which is about $3.00. They work well, bought them to clean all the electronic screens through the house,..as I mentioned, if they were just a little bit moister, I think they would be perfect Best and by far the most consistent reading scale I have ever owned. The low profile and size works perfectly in my smaller bathroom. Great looking. Smooth surfaces are easy to clean ( rarely needed ). Accuracy appears to be right on when compared to another scale well noted for accuracy. Scale numbers are very bright and of a size that is easy to read. It does what it is supposed to do extremely well. This is the only scale I would recommend. Great game for \"oldies\" wanting a WWII game/flying type. It is still challenging even though it has slower planes This was an upgrade from my old phone, I love the bigger screen, the much faster processor plus the fact that it is a quad core makes multi tasking so smooth. Setup and import of contacts was perfect. I realize the phone only has 8gb of internal memory but I only use my phone for texting, calling and email so, I don't for see this being a problem. Cheap price for such a quality product, very happy! Delivery went great, wonderful price=$629.00! bought the matching washer too. Excellent game. Loses some points for driving (sucks) and clich\u00e9d main character. Unique game and an excellent experience! I had purchased this to use for college instead of a laptop because the battery life is longer. Most of my products at home are Samsung and makes it really easy to connect them all together. I also like that it is lightweight for the size of the screen. Needed a new version of office since my other one was outdated. Glad I purchased the new upgraded version. This product absolutely does exactly what it says it will do.\n",

        "Highly recommended I love the hacking! I've never had that ability before so it feels amazing to have that power in an open world game The installer only put one on but it works good. It is sure to last a lot longer than the rubber hoses. ,..just load card and it goes into Seam wallet for when ever you need it.  This purifier makes a great noticeable difference in the air quality. I was struggling with bad allergies at night, seasonal and a little from my dog too. I couldn't breath out of my nose and had a sore throat when I woke up. I now use this purifier when I go to sleep and have not had any problems since, even with my dog in bed with me. It's great! It's a little loud but well worth it. I bought one for my sister who struggles with allergies as well. was unable to use the wifi option to watch Netflix. had to plug in cord to connect to the internet to watch Netflix. Perfect strength. Not too thick, smooth touch. THIS DID WORK WORH THE OTTERBOX DEFENDER AS LONG AS YOU TAKE THE DEFENDER SCREEN PROTECTOR OFF. easy to use and extremely better than COMCAST COULD EVER DREAM OF MAKING!!! I used this to transfer data from 500 gb hard drive to 120 ssd. Much easier to use than a enclosed hhd . I like this game better than Battlefield 3 and 4. I like the variety of weapons that the game has. I also like the challenging levels. Great for movie night something the whole family can enjoy I got this phone about 2 months ago and I am very impressed. However, Windows Apps are not that great. Good case size for a smaller camera. I bought this for a Canon S110 and it's a bit larger but I needed space for extra cards and a battery. I would recommend this movie and think it would be a great addition to any collection. Bought as a gift. Nephew says he's enjoying the way it protects his phone It's different than any washer I ever had. the inside moves randomly and it sets really low. Bought this after reading great reviews for this speaker box. I primarily wanted it for my backyard parties. Worked great &amp; I was impressed with the clear sound. Speakers don't get distorted even with max volume. I got lots of compliments on the speaker &amp; now they want one too. Something the whole family can enjoy and it was pretty close to the book Easy to get everything up and running... fast processing! Have had a couple of months now and I think it is doing a great job. I haven't really noticed an odor, but I leave the lid open and also pull open the soap drawer to air out. Clothes spin out really good and probably take less time in the dryer. I have NOT noticed my dark clothes coming out with any soap residue. I would recommend this. I bought this laptop as a gift for my niece. She only has praises for the product so far. She uses it for doing schoolwork among other things, and she has been enjoying every bit of it Gave this product as a gift to my God daughter. She seem to be enjoying so far Great picture and sound. I know in time they will add more capabilities. I sure hope so anyways...... Without it your ability to look professional and be organized is limited.\n",
        "no more \"read only\" problems and with my windows phone to match\n",
        "I can easily keep it all together with the One Drive. got it for granddaughter, a teenager, to protect new iPhone. case is durable and affordable compared to not having one. She had good selection of colors, case was easy to put on phone and no longer need to worry about replacing expensive screen or phone itself if she drops it or it gets wet. Other cases were less expensive, but not waterproof. Took less than 15 minutes to set up. Very easy to use I bought this laptop tote so I could have one for a new computer I purchased. It has lots of room for you laptop and cord if you need to carry it with you plus it has room for other things if you need to take them with. I find it is too wide for a small lounge chair no room to move around it When this cd came out, I was planning a joint wedding with my daughter. We both loved beginnings for the theme of our wedding and now fourteen years later, it still is my favorite. For the money, it's a good deal. It has clear sound and it is much better than holding the phone to your ear. I am not technologically savvy, and I was able to set this up and watch movies with my grandson. It was very use friendly. We have a lot of home video VHS tapes and are in the process of transferring them to DVD. This will reduce the storage space immensely and we are told, the DVDs last longer than the VHS tapes. The Scandisk works well with other devices besides cameras. It is good for tablets also. It helps you store more, especially when used with the tablet. I recommend this product to anyone with a camera or a tablet where more storage space is needed. The product is priced fairly and works great. It is a good accessory for my tablet. I bought this mouse for my laptop so it would be easier to play games and do everything you normally do with a mouse. Definitely reccommed! I was very pleseaed with the price of the computer and loved that it is touch scream it is very easy to use This is my first experience with a wireless printer. Took a little bit of time to set up settings, etc. Seems to work well, prints quickly, but best of all it will print on both sides of the paper. Twice, when turning on, I have had to go to the menu on the printer to turn off the wireless, then turn back on to re-establish the wireless connection so it would print. Not sure whether that is due to my router, or the printer. I only use the printer occasionally, so I turn it completely off when not in use, instead of letting it go to standby mode. Overall, I am happy with this purchase. Great headphones, use them all the time. Only downside I've had is that usually after about 6-8 months or so the left ear headphone always dies. Other then that there great headphones and would recommend them to anyone. I am retired and am learning how to use a tablet. I find it easy to transport when I am traveling and fun to use with all the many choices of apps. It's also practical as I can access email, banking and keep up with the news. I can also find local maps and places of interest. This movie is so underrated. Everyone should see this flick! Lots has been written about this movie and the ending will surprise anyone. The movie has much deeper meanings that just being a good movie on the surface. Go watch it! These were an upgrade from a pair of 3 way 6.5's, the sound stage and sound quality are on par with Polk's reputation. After the break in period, I was very impressed with these speakers! Buy them you wont regret it! Printer has additional features that are easy to use. Menu is pretty straight forward Very Nice product, I always like Alpine products. sounds great in my car. If you like fast &amp; quick not quite punk music you should check out thie new EYEHATEGOD cd! If you like Arson Anthem &amp; The stuff coming out of Housecore Records you will not be disappointed in this one, I promise u that!!! Prefect product for the purpose its made for: find media on your phone (of course on compatible apps. e.g. youtube, netflix, etc and my favorite allcast which enables you to stream photos and video you have taken with your phone) Its very handy to share a web page with my family and friends in the room without all of them gathering around my laptop. I love it and will be using it for a long time. Im very happy with the basics of this tablet, but im not happy about amazon app store, after that is as good as an ipad or a samsung It is easy to both charge and to use. Good value for the price. Haven't read the books, but the movies are tolerable. I was surprised how good of a picture this had on the screen opposed to the camera that was out for the PS3. I think this will eventually be a big part of gaming with the PS4 but it's not that big of a deal yet. I bought PlayStation 4 and Sony Tv to play this game because I believe it's worth it. It's true that it cost me a lot of money but I'm very happy with it. Like any show that was too good, it was cut short. So suits The Spectacular Spider-Man. This show is nothing short of fantastic and it looks great on Blu-ray. I wish there was more to the show. As in more episodes. More special features would have been nice too but even so, I cannot recommend this series enough. Fan of Spider-Man? Got something that plays Blu-rays? Don't hesitate, buy it. This Sony camera takes fantastic pictures... very clear, very sharp. The camera is very small in size as well which makes it easy to take with you on the run, while biking/hiking/camping/etc. My only issue with this camera is the weird flash that pops up like a Jack-in-the-box... it sits atop the end of an extension from the camera body. The flash works well and I'm sure there's a reason to extend it from the body like it is but the mechanism seems very fragile and would break easily.\n",
        "\n",
        "Otherwise, the camera is great and I would recommend it. If it had a hot-shoe for external flashes, it would be perfect. The Targus Laptop Charger is a cost effective solution for those who need a second adapter for travel, or a replacement adapter for their current laptop. The charger features built-in surge protection to keep all of your laptop devices safe from unexpected surges and spikes. It also features an interchangeable tip system, which is convenient for those who own multiple laptops as it provides compatibility across major laptop brands. The Targus Laptop Charger is designed to support Acer, Asus, Compaq, Dell, Fujitsu, Gateway, HP, IBM, Lenovo, Panasonic, Sony and Toshiba right out of the box. This software was included as a bonus when I purchased my laptop. It was easy to install, and I am also able to load it on my old computer. It is a free 1-year subscription, so I am not sure what the renewal price will be at the end of the year. So far it seems to run great in the background, does not appear to slow down my system. It is a very basic dishwasher. I purchased it for income property, and am VERY happy with my purchase. It is worth what you pay, yet doesn't have any unnecessary frills. I have 3 nest thermostats and 3 nest protects and they work wonderfully as a system. Installation is straightforward and, if you have are comfortable with minor electrical work, downright easy. Nest is about the only wifi thermostat that works without a common wire.\n",
        "\n",
        "I've found that with a net gear nighthawk router, the thermostat will intermittently drop and reconnect. Didn't happen with the my older router. I installed the Seageate 1 TB SSHD on my mid 2009 13\" MacBook Pro because I needed additional storage space for my photo editing. The performance of this drive is very good, and I am very surprised that is very quiet. The SSHD technology seems to have matured to the point of being highly reliable. However, I do recommend doing a single partition format with Disk Utility and clean install of OSX 10.9 (I downloaded it from the Apple App store and created an install drive on an 8 GB SD card). I then used Time Machine to restore my files and other apps. I have had no problems since, and the drive is getting faster as the program files are cached to the NAND memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "The only reason I gave the \"ease of installation\" a 4 rather 5 is because of the effort required to do a clean install. Its a controller and if you want to play multiplayer or have a backup for when your battery needs recharge you need one. A must buy IMO. This camera is great for traveling because it's so small and light. When you snap a picture it takes a long time to get ready for the next one. The screen is good size. Using the buttons to review photos is works fine but I think there are too many steps to delete a photo. But the price is right. If you like sports cars and racing games this game if for you!!! I rather pay a little more bucks for the 564XL ONE THAN the regular cartridge 564 one This is perfect if you just need to do a quick shave before going to work or something of the sort. It doesn't exactly perform miracles, but for the price you can sure do a lot worse. Recommended. amazing........................................... I use the \"XL\" when ever I can so I don't have to keep buying the regular cartridge. I bought this battery to replace an aging battery that wouldn't hold a charge. The new battery seems to work well. I didn't get a chance to see this when it was in theaters but not too long ago I caught it when it was on HBO. Immediately I regretted not watching it when it first came out because I've become obsessed with it.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's visually stunning and an overall fun, action-packed movie. However, for me, the characters are the best part. They are all so diverse, each with their own interesting story, bringing a very emotional and human element to the whole story.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sure, PR is a little spoon fed but it's a fun movie everyone can enjoy. I was never a soccer fan but I got this game in a bundle and I can't stop playing it!!! Best gaming system on the market!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I bought this battery to replace an aging battery that wouldn't hold a charge. The new battery seems to work well. Overall, I really like this Lenovo Yoga 11\" laptop. Lightweight, clear and sharp display. Even though it is just a Pentium, still starts quickly and loads programs and internet pages fast enough for me. Windows 8.1 wasn't that hard to get used to, I like the live tiles. The keyboard has good response, as well as the mousepad. Had to purchase an external cd/dvd drive, have not tried to use it yet. My only negative is I bought the Lenovo cover for the Yoga laptop which suggested I could put over the keyboard when in the tablet mode, and it turned off the laptop when it bumped the power button on the side. Other than that, I am totally happy with this purchase. Lost my charger during a trip and needed to buy a replacement. This was a good value and worked well Good charger, work quick and cored is a good lenght For those who are into music and graphics the Ipad is better in those qualities. but for those who are into the business package with programs for writing and spreadsheets the Samsung is a more compete tool. It is neither better or worse than the Ipad, simply with a different focus. I find it the best tool for writing and creating books and manuscripts. Great product so far. Guards my laptop against viruses and spams I had them for about 2 months or longer and everything is great the paint is coming off but hardly noticeable I enjoy the game for about an hour and then I am ready to move on. It is worth having, just not what I expected from a NFS game. I have a lot of files on my tablet which use a lot of memory. This flash drive is small enough to carry in my tablet case without being bulky. It meets my requirements 100%. I may buy another one in the not too far future. I take it with me whatever I go. excellent to streaming movies or browsing this is a good product. I have one on all of our tvs. I found the game to be well worth all of the delays! Easy to install. Looks Great. works Great. Simple and easy to use the kids think it looks cool , the way it lights up. Easy to install if the proper utilities are used. Very durable one of the many products that are all tied together by apple. However its emphasis is on music and art and not as good for those with low vision. The touchscreen requires additional options for those with vision difficulties. These are in general minor points and not anythign that effects the overall ability and use of the tablet. Another movie good for movie night where the whole family can enjoy It is a solid Doom Metal Cd from the 1st song to the last song!! If you are a Crowbar fan the cd is worth the wait since the last Crowbar!! If you like Doom Metal it is a cd you most definatley need to check this cd out!! You will not be disappointed!! Love the size and the screen is blest and easy to read Fun game that tries to compare to the greatness of Grand Theft Auto but inevitably falls short in delivery. Easy to install if proper utilities are used. great aesthetic appeal Great sound quality, definitely a top end product. Set up was very easy. Works well from the computer or the iPhones. Very versatile in what you want played and where. I plan to expand the system very soon. Catching Fire is my favorite of the HG series and this movie does not disappoint. It was exactly how I had always imagined the book. The ending leaves you even more excited for the next movie and I definitely can't wait to see it. The product came with high recommendations, and I am happy with it. The emails have me concerned, because when I clicked on toinstall thinking it was an update, my desktop changed and I needed help getting back to my beginnings. When I went shopping for this, I was looking for something that would protect my new phone and look good doing it. After looking at several possibilities, I picked up this one and made up my mind. It was just what I needed. Similar to GTA open world style. Average story. Nothing spectacular about this game. Would recommend if on sale. Great usb flash drive for a cheap price. Cheap plastic material however. Needed this to extend wifi to the whole house. Set it up halfway from the original wifi to the rest of the house - we now have wifi throughout the house. Took maybe 25 minutes to set up without me being very tech savvy. Very happy with product. These batteries are the way to go when extra long service life is a must, especially in low drain devices. This movie is amazing lots of adventure and suspense. This is a great item for first time users. I found it easy to use and program and love the way it works. VTech makes a great phone that comes with three handsets so I can plug them in around the house. The phone has a base with keypad and answering machine built in. You can add your cell phones if it is compatible with the system so that they ring on the land line phone as well. For the price it is a good phone that works well and I have four kids that constantly leave it off the base so it has to be recharged and that does not take to long. This phone is the ish. I've had it since April and Im still learning things about it. The only thing I am not too satisfied with is the quality of pictures. Some look gorgeous and others look not so clear. Over all I would recommend it to a friend. can't go wrong with an iphone5. it's lighter than the 4 with a bigger screen and just as easy to use. This is a good case to protect my IPhone. I like the black color and material. I absolutely LOVE this movie! The songs are pretty catchy too lol It's a game that I'm very happy I purchased. . The graphics are great and also the actual game play keeps you entertained... it's worth the money as well as its a great game to add to my Xbox one collection considering there's not too many games out there... A basic earbud set which is good for the price, which was only about $10.  This little package is a bit over priced, but it's worth it if you can't afford an air compressor machine. I got a beast of a rig and this canister allows me to blow out all the dust really nicely. I recommend you tape the straw to the lip. That way it doesn't fly out on you in the middle of your cleaning process. It's a pretty standard product, but it is a good one. Got it for my husband ds older tom tom GPS and it as a perfect fit, the right prive and sturdy! Also versatile. In this movie with Jennifer Aniston and Jason Bateman, the character played by Jennifer Aniston decides to get pregnant using artificial insemination. But who was the donor? Watch the movie to see what happens next. Good film When I was 7, my grandmother bought an NES to keep me entertained whenever we visited. I had one of my own at home, but she bought bizarre, difficult, and confidence-shattering games the likes of which I'd never seen before. I remember popping in Castlevania II and immediately feeling lost, as if the game was designed to punish me for not holding some sort of impossible-to-ascertain bit of knowledge. I'd yell at the TV, throw controllers after falling through a DIFFERENT floor tile for the hundredth time, and stomp off to play outside after reaching my limit of being unable to summon a tornado or make a jump. Armed with magazine snippets and playground tips, I'd return to the game with each visit and progress a little farther. The weekend that I beat the game felt like as legitimate an accomplishment as I could find in gaming.\n",

        "DS is as challenging as it is rewarding - every success and every failure comes as a result of your efforts, patience, and networking with other gamers to discover secrets or massage the games stats, animations, and design to your needs. You'll die, a lot. You'll make mistakes, a lot. You'll likely swear, dependent upon self-control. But when you beat a boss, reach an item or weapon, defeat a level, or even *gasp* beat the game, you'll feel a true sense of victory. Great for little jobs, store well. Tell my friends Connected an Akai midi mini keyboard with pads and it worked with every synth software I chose to experiment with. Great for home use and home office, and for our personal use , banking and pictures and music I have always loved the sound of Pioneer speakers, and these are no exception. Nice bass and highs. I added some XTC speaker baffles with some fiberfill to tighten them up. I expect them to sound even better once the amp and subs are added to the system. They are powered by the deck for now and sound great. I am very happy with the folio stand case for the kindle fire.. it works out just great.\n",

Without a clip ,it is hard for me to multi task. The case keeps my iPod clean Lets see it one more time with feeling. I've been updating my DVD collection to BluRay and this was a must have. Picture looks better than ever and the movie still gives me the chills. And you can't beet the price $$$ great deal. Some of the story lines were not so great compared to previous seasons. While it's good to have the writers shake things up a bit, it's uncomfortable to have Horatio step outside the law by torturing an injured prisoner and so on. Good cliffhanger at the end gears you up for the final season! Not being the techy my husband is I thought it would be redundant, but I do like the quality of the blu-ray movies. And we now get Netflix in the living room! I like the charger. I wish that the cord and the charger would come together because between the 2 things you need to charge it comes to $40. It's a plot that can be expected due to it being based off of a true story. Great ending for those who have yet to see it. It works and does what it is suppose to, no problem Buy it you'll appreciate your life just a little more. We like this products because it is very easy to use. The price is very reasonable and our service is always friendly. Great cord looks good and good color. I wish they had more colors to choose from. Its a case. An awfully expensive case... Probably the best folio case you can buy, but like I said it comes at a very high price. Dyson products are above all other name brand products This is very use full when others are watching tv and u want to surff on internet The iPad mini is a great device with all the necessary features you need in being connected. Great product for a good price. Fast shipping. Long battery life. Needed new landlines and have had Vtech before. Easy to set up and program. Has all the features I wanted at a good price. Didn't want an answering machine option and many phones came with that. Good looking and compact. This is just what I needed and it does the job as intended. Absolutely hands down 1 of the best comedies on tv. Dark and definitely not politically correct. My grandson is always listening to his iPod he would recommend it. He even uses the video in his graphic design class. The comments below are the rating that my grandson gave this product. This was my first time using a solid state and I didn't know much about them. With some assistance from a friend I have it set up how I wanted to and they are by far one of the best decisions you will ever making with your computer. I RECOMENDED TO SOME FRIENDS IS EASE TO USE AND I CAN WATCH MOVIES Decided to get larger memory card from new Nikon Coolpix S9600. What else does one say about a memory card? I use my shaver all the time for under arm and chest I remember seeing this movie in the theaters and enjoying it. I recently went to see Meatballs 2 and then decided to purchase the first one for my collection. Great graphics and gameplay. Hundreds of cars, good variation of tracks. This product had completely satisfied me. My whole family had bought the beats brand and everyone loves it. When it comes to read/write drives there isn't much that can go wrong. You can pretty much get whatever you want and it is going to suffice. I chose this one due to a recommendation and have no problems with it so I consider it a good investment. Set up in 5 minutes, works great, my son uses it for playing music from his iphone. Syncs quickly to any other device without a problem.\n",
        "Great price, perfect for setting up with a stereo system. The movie making made me feel like I was right in the middle of the action. The stop action made the fight scenes more enjoyable because you could see what was happening instead of it going so fast. Very enjoyable. Great value! Cost less to by the two pack and to buy two singles. Doesn't take long to charge. The charge holds. When they do die the other are aready charged and ready to go. Changing them out is simple and takes no time at all perfect when gaming. A very good modem . Very easy to install and setup. Will eliminate your lease fee for cable modem so in long run will save you money. The 5ghz makes for less interference than the 2.4ghz giving you faster speed I am currently using a two monitor set up with two of these monitors and I have had zero issues with them. You must buy this for the installer to put in the new dishwasher. I picked this bag so that I could carry my new Nikon Coolpix 9600, the battery charger and USB cord as well as a spare battery. the bag is small yet everything fits nicely. it is a good product I have not had problems with it Good game something different titans are amazing but at the same time easy to kill unless your good. There is no real campaign just a story board with the same audio clips win or lose. Itraded in my call of duty for this game and don't regret it at all really no bad spawn points granted it can happen once in awhile but not enough to throw a controller. They are always updating the game to adding game modes fixing player matching are just a couple of the changes they have done. All in all a safe buy It's a good basic keyboard. The height adjustment feet below keyboard do nothing to lift or lower angle; it is pretty much flat on table. It will take some getting used to. It has good tactile feel, but a transition from a clickity-clack keyboard. Location of some keys not standard (escape key is located below \"volume decrease\" button). Using it for gaming, and you may find yourself in console mode as I have accidentally hit \"tilde\" several times in trying to maneuver in online battle games. It's a good keyboard that I have grown used to. Not much effort to push keys. I still prefer the older type keyboards. This was fine for the price. *Never pay more than $20 for a keyboard* Good system, range is pretty adequate thru the house. excellent value,my clerk was exceptionaly helpful with picking the products I needed for my tv Was easy to apply and works very well. The screen looks great and hd, and you can't even tell it's on when screen is lit. It also claims that scratches(dents in screen protector) and air bubbles will work themselves out and repair. I have noticed some but not all repairing. Overall it's definitely worth the money! every time im just flipping the channels I have to stop and watch when its on ive seen it more times than I can remember so awsome The CD includes 16 of Kristofferson's greatest hits from his storied career as a singer-songwriter and member of the Country Music Hall of Fame including solo hits such as Me and Bobby Mcgee and including a duet with Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson and Johnny Cash from his days as a member of the Highway men. Be careful not to take out these little plastic clips at the bottom of the basket, they serve a purpose. Good size tablet for work, prefer this over the iPad Mini. Great burner for the money, so far so good with burning CDs. Havent tried to do anything with movies yet but will soon I enjoyed watching this movie, however it was a little bit scary to think that the industry is like that. The product protects my IPAD very well. I like the color very much. The magnetic closer it very easy to use. The turning mechanism is much better than others I have looked at. My favorite NBA player is LeBron James so naturally I would love this game. Great soundtrack and enhanced defense moves! Greatly enjoyed \"Big\" in the movies and have the VHS tape but wanted the DVD with the extras on it. Acting is good and the storyline is an interesting one. Tom Hanks and Robert Loggia were so good in it and it brings one back somewhat to think about when they were younger. Got extra battery for my Nikon Coolpix 9600. Both original battery and this one as a backup hold the charge for long time. For me a \"long time\" is a battery that lasts all day taking over 100 shots. Although I do turn the power off in between long delays taking shots. The performance is as expected for electric razor. If you have an electric razor that costs more than $80 or so, replacing the blades at least once during its life is a decent investment. Of course, considering the cost of replacement blades, replacing more than a couple of times starts adding up--to the point that you will be better off buying a new razor. What I like the most about this radio is it's play back feature. Where u can play back a song that u just heard. Also this radio will show the album cover for the song. also it will record all of your preset stations so u can switch over and playback through to find a favorite song. I absolutely love her singing so good a must have cd A fun new kirby game with the classic style of gameplay Kirby fans will enjoy. The new powers included are great and I like how each power dramatically changes your move set. I love Hoover and I have missed using a good vacuum I like the game so far. It's a thinking game and requires you to recall your last steps to move forward. If the mission is not completed successfully, it doesn't make you start over, it brings you back to where you left off. wished I had this product a long time ago, it's fast &amp; easy, &amp; does a real great job on keeping me safe &amp; secure, &amp; removes all virus's, yes, get's them all, would not use any other product again, I love it Good machine. I tried to take out these plastic pieces at the bottom of the gasket, however they do belong there. I bought these earbuds for my teenage son, who normally goes through a pair about every 3 weeks or so. So far, they've been working pretty well, and I haven't had any requests from my son for a new pair. Glad to see this show is progressing well and that they are nearing the start of season five. More Annie! These are a great set of basic speakers. Got a new computer for the office that didn't include speakers. Didn't need anything fancy or high-end as don't use them to listen to music, videos or for gaming. These work just fine for webinars and an occasional YouTube video. Easy plug-and-play installation. Easy to adjust sound level. Sound is well balanced between the two speakers. No hissing or crackling. All cables/wires are of adequate length. The speakers are a bit larger and boxier than I would have liked so do take up some space if placed on a desk. It's not a lot but enough to make them a bit difficult to place out of sight. Ended up just setting them on top of the new computer tower. Works just fine like that. Great headphones with great sound. I recommend these for sound cancellation. Great in airplanes! Movie wasn't bad by any means, I am glad to have picked ity up at such a low price! We are not the most skilled at these things, but installation was fairly easy. The key was finding studs in the wall so that the bracket is as sturdy as possible. We could have hung it without finding the studs, but chose to move it a few inches for the added installation ease. I think most of these brackets are overpriced, however, by shopping around, we were able to save a few dollars. I love this phone... The video zoom is phenomenal! Camera quality is u parallel! Very fast mp3 transfer speed from computer to SD CARD The only thing I would change about this game is that it should teach you the routines one by one. I had to watch several times before I memorized the steps. It's more fun and you burn more calories when you can keep up with the people in the game. Chris Farley and David Spade play a great pair in this film. A classic worth watching over again. I bought this product in order to save important documents and pictures from my personal computer. The computer is now 6 years old and out of date so I wanted to make sure I did not lose my pictures and documents. Eddie Murphy plays a cop in this comedy. Watch the movie for laughs. It is one of the most outstanding of any of the apple products I have used. The 22X zoom is spectacular. Camera is small enough to carry around in my pocket. Lots of features like panoramic shots, scene selections. Also liked the sports feature that takes multiple shots of action. Still trying to figure out how to connect the phone to my iPad using wi-fi. I use this when traveling in Airplanes. It is great at reducing background noise. works easily with the PS3 and makes it so I can manage which segment of a series I can view An excellent action film, though I didn't think this one was quite as good as the first in the series. A lot of action, but not as much dialogue, but then again it is an action movie. I bought this CD so that I could have all the nominated songs on one CD without having to buy or download each song separately. Evil Dead has to be one of my favorite classic horror films, really glad it received the steelbook treatment. Once you get familar with Windows 8, it is easy to use. I went from XP to 8 as my old machine crashed before I could update to Windows 7. I had no choice and I am very glad that my old machine bit the dust. This is the end all, be all of MacBook pros!!! Everything else fails in comparison! this looks good, has good radio reception but is difficult to set up with complex series of back and forth button clicks It's a great game. So many direction that you can take your quest. You can up grade items that you want in order to help you in the quests. Leveling up can be easy at times. If you don't like the first character you make. You can make another and start a new game and change what you didn't like about your character. Have played it for a 52 hour stretch didn't even know it. I have got bored yet!!! There are some glitches that keeps this game from being excellent across the board. Thats the only reason I purchased this CD.Check out Jakes playing, seems like he needs to polish it up a little bit. A classic film from 1997 comes to Blu-ray. The film is a great spoof of spy films and the picture quality on Blu-ray is very good, even better than I thought it would be. An overall great pair of headphones if you don't mind stepping up and dropping a Benji for them. I bought this router to increase my wifi. I have 3 smart TV's, 2 Laptops, 2 smart phones, and desktop. All work good with this router. I used to own an E2600 and couldn't get all my devices to work, but with this I can. I can get wifi in my back yard which is a plus, so I can do yard work or sit by my pool to listen to music or surf the web. Internet speed reliant. Poor interactions with TimeWarner cable boxes and remotes. DVDs look like Soap Opera Videos. Not 100% thrilled. exactly what I needed for my printer...fits, easy to use and works Left my original Apple charger out of town and needed a replacement. This charger was a less expensive replacement option than the OEM version and is also a little more powerful so it charges the device faster than the original. easy to install. nothing complicated. anyone can use these cables This movie was non stop laughing. A great family movie. It is an older movie but still good. Some parts are a little off but not bad.  We are using the TV in our bedroom and love it. The only criticism would be that there is a reflection of our bedside lamp although that is probably more an issue of lamp placement than TV. I owned the older version which is bigger than this slimmed down version. Since I had a good experience with my old device, I decided to try this new slim device too. It's as easy to install and use as its predecessor, yet it occupies less space. Price is reasonable. I'd recommend this product to anyone who wants to score family photos and a storage device to back up files. Great soundtrack at a great price on line stock listing was incorrect but the first store helped find which one had it Great product! Works well with my Samsung smart tv! Shows a clear picture on the television. Easy controls and features. I love this phone ...I was a apple guy until I got rid of my last iphone for a S3 and now I have this amazing S5 ... I like when I can get my moneys worth. 2 movies for the price of one and reasonalby priced I was looking for something affordable, yet of high quality and good performance, and I found it! Excellent! I really like this GPS mount. It sits right on the dashboard. No suction cups, nothing hanging off the window. You can move it wherever you want. Its a heavy bean bag type of material so the mount doesn't slide all over. The only thing that can be annoying is that you need to take the back clip off if you want to put the GPS in to a case. It's sturdy and I am confident it will last a long time. This model complimented our kitchen theme. It's attractive and much quieter than past models. This is a product every iPhone and iPad owner should have. The airplay audio and video feature alone is worth the cost. I also think it has the best Netflix app of any network player. I love my MacAir..So simple to use and very friendly. For what I paid for this I would expect the processor to be faster. Overall quality seems fine for everyday use. It does its job without any issues and thats what I needed. I would highly recommend over an inkjet printer. It's easy to set up and prints great Very clear picture with good color. Works well when watching netflix or surfing he web. My only complaint would be that the screen seems to have some glare when any sunlight enters the room. This product was easy to set up out of the box. The set up instructions were clear and easy to follow. There was an immediate increase in speed and strength of connection with the wifi range extender. So far there have been no glitches. Great computer..Using it for both pleasure and business.. Lots of super heroes characters to chose from. Challenging to find which ones to use for each task that needs done. Completing more to unlock characters keeps it interesting. If you like Lego themed games, this one is great! Good GPS with ease of use, but not always accurate. Rivals a titan at way less cost. Just make sure you have the correct PSU hook ups. i wish it had taller places on top have to lay salad bottles down on top maybe more room / i had to go with this one because of the width I consider this telescope a very good one. This was my first telescope and I was so excited to get this. The first time i used this i was blown away. I saw everything from the moon to the planets to planetary nebulae. The best was the ring and bubble nebulae. beautiful. Very easy with the go to mount. Definitely a good gift for birthday or Christmas. I bought a MacBook Air that my mom will use from time to time and so she wanted a mouse to use. The Magic Mouse may be a little pricey but the design and ease of use are great. I wouldn't recommend laptop owners to purchase a mouse because it may be a bit unnecessary. But if you do need one for a Mac product, the magic mouse is a good choice. Awesome charger when it comes to speed as it's much faster than the old apple charger. I wish it was as durable as that was. You have to literally plug in the charger and DONT TOUCH IT or it can bend at either end and cease to ever work again. Overall though Apple makes fantastic products as we all know. I have faith that Apple will figure out how to continue with the lightning fast charge without compromising the durability. Having fun learning how to use the lens and what all I can do with it.. High quality sound you might expect from headphones in a comfortable earbud headset. This is a great action movie that could be much better if the character were built up more and had more of a plot I have been using the KIS for many years, I was tried to use some thing else but finally I stick with them until now. The most trust program and very strong recommend for any one using windows OS. Very useful and best program that i was known. Having an Xbox is simply not the same without this amazing kinect! This movie is great at following the main character and truly understanding their point of view. Certainly a great small TV for the price. Picture quality is great for a small TV, however sound quality is average. It gets loud enough, but it's not exactly high quality. Light weight and very easy to wall mount. Remote is simple and easy to use, no complaints. All buttons on the TV itself are on the top, so if you wall mount high, be aware. For us, this was a perfect fit wall mounted in the kitchen under the cabinets. Great product. Our first experience with a front load, HE washer, and we keep the door open in between uses to keep from having odor issues others have faced. Cleans great, but figuring out all the options and abilities is a bit confusing at first. Once you know what you want out of it-and it'll do almost anything you need-it's great. This movie leaves you wanting more, but not the good kind. The second one I ordered was not defective. Great, large, vibrant touchscreen. Loving it so far. I am feel very confident to buy this charger to replace the old one was lost, it's working great and happy with purchase! Apple product is the best ever... It's okay product for a home theater receiver..... I needed a spare battery for my gopro and just picked up one of these, it works great and have had no issues with it. This mouse is great slim low profile with touch scrolling I use rechargeable batteries Actually made for phones but I put it in my DSLR camera and worked perfect. Very reliable, great memory and speed. Why pay more when you can get all the best for a low price. I have it for my camera, back up for the original one, it's really fast and look faster than the original, working good until now, no any issue and they have the software easy to do a recovery any accident delete file or image. Great deals, great product! A great mix of Soca music. from all over the carribbean This keyboard is slim white so easy to see light touch keys worth every penny! Bought it for keeping the computer cooler with about 5 fans, pretty quiet when running and still run good until now...Great price and very good fan. MLB The Show 14 is as real as it gets. The graphics on next gen are amazing. The detail in the player faces, the crowd, environment, stadiums, and broadcast angles are perfect. I needed Microsoft office for school so i chose this product because it is cheaper than buying the standard edition. Getting verified as a student was very easy. I already had Office installed on my MacBook Air on a trial basis so the install of this product was easy. All i had to do was enter the activation code and i was all set. Office 365 University works on a Mac just as it would on a PC.I would definiltey recommend the product for students who need Office and are looking to save a bit of cash. Product is good for 4 years but by then, I'm sure i'll be out of school and a newer version will be available. You get what you pay for best I have ever owned! BUY IT The PS4 is amazing. The difference that you see with the graphics from the PS3 is extremely noticeable. The new controller is way more comfortable then the old one. The future is here. Go get one now! Love this game. Watching the kids play caused me to play it myself. I purchased this surge protector after my old one needed to be replaced, and it has worked perfectly. It was very easy to install. great purchase, very accurate, love the online feature This was very easy to install, and I have not had any issues. The memory is the best choice for smart phone like Samsung Galaxy or any camera with a adapter included. Fast data transfer and very easy to use ! Great on price too... This is a good little enclosure that I bought for a spare laptop drive I had once the XBOX One turned on the external drive support. It does exactly what I needed it to do. Works great! No complaints! This game brings the Amazing Spider-man story to life and lets you gain control of his powers to rid the world of crime. Easy to use Blu Ray player. Performs functions easily. Compatible with Samsung TV we have. Replaced another brand of Blu Ray player we had that didn't even last 1 year. ScanDisks are great. High quality usb's that are very versatile. Back up your movie or music on the usb and plug it in to your blu ray player...there you go...you can also load your mp3s on it and play them on your car stereo - beats dragging around cases of cds and it fits in your pocket. Slick. I bought these for my 9 year old son that plays the keyboard so now he doesn't have to worry about making too much noise. It also came with adapter for his keyboard. The product is simple and easy to use. I took it out of the box and had it working in just a few minutes. The user guide was very clear and easy to use which made the initial set up easy. We have been using it for a few weeks now and have had no issues or problems. I don't always have my phone on me, so it is great when I can check my email right from my wrist. Since I just had a knee replacement the pedometer is great way to keep me moving through out the day. The story is great but the music will have your kids singing every time they here the songs played on the radio! The Lego Movie is simply awesome and having kids that love Lego's only makes it more awesome. I Love this DVD grown up's. The DVD shows Really Good. The price for this DVD was Really a Great Price. I would Recommend anyone to go toBest Buy and Purchase their movies! :-) Overall great case for the price. Keeps the I-Pad protected and held in place securely. Multiple propping positions and It's pink she absolutely love it!!! I got the screen at a sale, great screen especially for the price, my games and videos look great on the screen. One note to anyone looking to buy the screen is that it is a high gloss screen, meaning if the room you are in is very bright you will get reflections in the screen. Adjustment buttons can be a little difficult to push but I used them once anyway.\n",
        "The monitor also has an audio jack on the back which works when an an hdmi cord is used, I don't need to reach down to my computer to use my headphones\n",
        "Make sure to calibrate the settings when you bring home the monitor to get the best possible picture. You cannot beat the price of this flashdrive!! Holds lots of pics! This Samsung Plasma is a fantastic TV, especially for the price. Amazing Picture, Deep Blacks and smooth plasma motion. I was not expecting much after what I payed for it but this TV has blown me away. I would highly recommend this TV to anyone who is into games and sports. I have a very bright house during the day and this TV holds up fine and can be adjusted to get pretty bright if needed. Sound is just ok but that seems to be the case with most TV's these days. Now that Panasonic is out of the Plasma market its only Samsung and LG. The 5300 is a top notch TV and you just can't beat Plasma!!!!! This dryer has a huge capacity and gets loads done in one go instead of needing to run them multiple times to make sure they are dry. Purchased this product so my almost 2 year old could have headphones for our road trip. They fit her well and the sound was good. The plastic seemed a little flimsy but that is only because my kid was constantly pulling at them. They were a good buy for the price. I got this game because of the free WiiMote!!!!!!! Bought this I-Pad Air as a present for my daughters 9th birthday. As she says this is the best present ever. Very user friendly, large variety of free apps and excellent for facetiming . We bought this specifically for communications between us during vacation in Italy. We were able to communicate with facetime via Wi-Fi for free for 2 weeks every night without any problems. Love it! Great movie. Holds your interest throughout entire movie. I haven't bought a movie in a while, but this one I needed to buy If you never saw the old robocop, this might be nice for you. Great sound for a small speaker. I would highly recommend. It is worth the extra dollars as the first blue tooth speaker I bought (half the cost) was returned after a week. We have purchased a number of Apple TV's over the years and all have performed flawlessly. Apple continually updates available content, wifi is fast, and Apple TV works with a wide variety of other Apple devices with ease. Really enjoyed this album, would I would definitely recommend it to anyone! The type cover on my original Surface took some getting used to. The key placement and spacing was a hard adjustment for me compared to the laptop I was trying to replace. The keyboard for the Pro 3 fixes all of those issues. The slightly bigger keys and larger track pad make a huge difference. I like love the bottom drawer freezer; nice and deep and easy to reach. The shelf that can move to accommodate taller items is great. Overall I love my new fridge. I've wanted Beats for some time now and with the Solo 2 release I finally decided to make the purchase. I really enjoy the quality of the sound. $200 for headphones seems like a lot of money but I am very happy with my purchase. I'm actually listening to music more now that I have Beats. I completely understand that I'm paying a premium for the name on the headphones but if i had to do it all over, I'd definitely purchase again. I added an additional screen shield to compliment this unit for one extra step for my smartphone. Including this would be a real plus for the attraction of the overall package. I usually order online to save money on HDMI cables but needed one right away. This one was reasonable and worked fine I purchased a Surface when they were first released and then bought the Surface Pro 3 to replace the original. Huge improvement in hardware - especially the screen. The Pro 3 is much more tablet-like while retaining the power of an Ultrabook. If you are tired of carrying two computers on business trips, buy a Surface Pro 3. Great open world game that delivers great experience for the next gen consoles. I love the story to the campaign and other side missions. Great buy and worth every dollar! Vampires+elemental magic+hot guys=awesome! The girls aren't so bad either. It's just ink and works well so there's nothing more to say about it. i had 2000 slides to scan, all from family and church since i ever started 35mm in the 60's. I scanned them all in 2 days.\n",
        "They made nice large files, but not mega mega large, Good for display on 70\" or projection. Plan ahead to save scans of different subjects or years to different disks, because the scanner saves them in numerical order and can overwrite ones you have already done. if you are not careful. Best to use different sd cards. or connect to the computer.\n",
        "\n",
        "I really liked it and so does my neighbor now. I have purchased many tablets searching for the best fit for me and I have found it! Well done Samsung, well done! Great case, no room for charger, kids love it...,,, I have had no issues with the charger. I only had to get a new one because the old was lost This washing machine is great. It's large enough that we can finish all of our laundry in 2 loads instead of 4 or 5 and it can fit a comforter or sleeping bag in it. The only down side is that if you are short, a step stool may be needed to get clothes out of the bottom since the wash basin is pretty deep. You save a lot of money buyin this collection, rather than buyin every movie seperate. Bonus of digital copies is a great buy as well. I hope I can buy more of these 'collections' for other movies as well. oh yeah, as for the movie... come on... its x men! awesome!( This movie on Blue Ray was a show of beautiful color and sound; fare better then the non-blue rays I also have. The acting was very convincing and kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Great movie experience! I really enjoy my Mac! I've never had anything as nice as this is. Easy to use, easy setup. X-Men: First Class is a great movie that you will find yourself watching over and over again. This movie was directed Matthew Vaughn who directed Layer Cake (good movie you should also check out). This movie features James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Kevin Bacon, and Jennifer Lawrence. The movie is set in the 1970's and shows the start of the Professor X's X-Men. The movie has heart and is has a great cast that showcase some great acting chops. The bad boys are tough and menacing unlike some weaker superhero movies. I love the color of my beats. They are loud but they don't blow my ear drums out. I would recommend beats to anybody! The Wolverine is a 2013 is the sixth installment in the X-Men film series and the second film headlining Wolverine after X-Men Origins: Wolverine in 2009. Hugh Jackman reprises his role from previous films as the title character, with James Mangold directing a screenplay written by Scott Frank and Mark Bomback, with uncredited parts by Christopher McQuarrie, based on the 1982 limited series Wolverine by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller. In the film, which follows the events of X-Men: The Last Stand, Logan travels to Japan, where he engages an old acquaintance in a struggle that has lasting consequences. Stripped of his immortality, Wolverine must battle deadly samurai as well as his inner demons. First game I purchased for my PS4. Great graphics,gameplay and multiplayer. What more could you ask for in a next generation game. I haven't even finished this game yet and let me just tell you that everything about this game is incredible. From the hacking to the shoot out segments in between missions. The open world is phenomenal and the how the game plays is just excellent. Aidan Pearce is one of the most fantastic characters I have seen in a game even though he's always so serious, but how can you blame him? His 6 year old daughter, Lena, was murdered by someone in the mob but he must track down his daughter's killer and seek revenge for her. This game is just AMAZING! Please, if any of you are reading this review out there, do yourself a favor and pick up watch dogs right now. I promise you will not regret it. bought 1 camera and liked how easy it was to set up so i bought another 1. Only problem is sometimes wont connect. works more often than doesnt Shipped faster than expected..love it now can save a lot of movies and apps  OK...maybe I'm a little unfair here...but slight mushy keys can be an issue for some folks (including me),\n",

        "For the price: this is an excellent value. Windows office is easy for me to use. I set up posters and letters for charities that I am part of. I have worked with other computers and I find HP to be easy to connect everything to it and upload any material needed. I will continue to purchase this brand through out my life time. Our family is a big fan of Otterbox phone cases. They are sturdy and durable to protect an iPhone from drops to the floor! We have always used them and have never had damage to our phones. Definitely worth the price! bought this so we can check on house when we are not there.Was very easy to set up but doesnt allways stayed connected. Good value for the price Most Otterbox cases offer supreme impact protection for the average user, and this is no different. I was disapointed that this particular case does not offer water-resistance like some of the other cases with similar bulk (Lifeproof and Survivor), but on sale for under $50 makes this a better deal than most Watchdogs overall is a great game. The Chicago map layout is large enough to keep you busy. There are mini games that can keep you so occupied you will forget about the real game you are trying to play. The hacking mode make it fun to see how much money you can get or what the people are talking about. However at times the conversations are very repetitive. The game is basically a knock off of Grand Theft Auto but slightly less violent and a little more though provoking with the in-game puzzles you must beat. Overall it is a game someone will not just fish in two or three days as it has repeat ability based on everything included, definitely a keeper. I love,love this vacuum! If you are looking to buy a vacuum this is the one worth your money. The best suction you have ever seen. Would not own any other brand. We bought before Vizio brand it is a great quality/price and have all features you need for a smart tv, light weight and very friendly use. I'm a big fan of the type cover, it's extremely versatile and works well as a keyboard, cover, without adding bulk. This router/ modem was great. I had no regrets after purchasing it. It was very easy to set up. Worked right away and haven't had any problems with it since. It has dropped a few time from where I have it standing and it's very durable. Hasn't cracked or received a scratch on it. Great upgrade from my Surface RT, portable &amp; powerful. good movie for the grandkids no cussing or violence The case was a little difficult to get on at first, but great quality and all buttons work great in the case. while I don't use it often, I like having this bag available to store my camera when not in use. It's user friendly. Many features and what i love the most is the panoramic pictures i can take. Still getting familiar with using this camera but am having loads of fun playing around with the pictures I've taken thus far. Needed a new video card with HDMI input that supported dual monitors and this fit the bill perfectly. I don't game or anything fancy like that, just surf the interwebs, write code and watch online videos. I haven't noticed any issues. Great mulit purpose paper and the price is reasonable for HP. I love it! Easy to use. Good sound quality -hooked it up to my bose min and love it. HP has the best ink, great quality, and the XL ink last a long time. I bought this card to use with my Playstation and it works great! Very pleased! All the songs are great. My favorites are Bad Girl ft. Marilyn Manson and Hush Hush. Hello Kitty lyrics are fun. Also includes a song ft lead singer of Nickelback and it's great. If you are a Avril Lavigne fan you will not be disappointed and ig your not you may like it too. The explicit may be inapropirate for kids because of language and lyrics. I love it I always had sony tvs but for the price and picture its great wth my ps4 for frame speeds no freezing set up was easy and basic .could use better sound not worried about it too much because I have a sound bar already would recommend one if you buy this tv Great protection. Keeps the phone small, doesn't add additional size. Installs in seconds. No complaints. Yes I would recommend. Nothing bad to say about it . Just wish it would hold more ink. I like that each color is separate. So if only one is low I can buy it separate instead of all the colors. Finally we have a spider-man series that it closer to the comics! The film quality and acting are both top notch. Definitely one needed for blu ray collection. The movie is a great way for kids to understand the impact animals, insects and people have on the environment. The ink gives very good quality documents. Not the best for photos. I purchased the SD card along with the Samsung Galaxy S5 and they work very well together. No complaints about the size and its nice to be able to have the option of upgradable memory. I saw the movie with my kids age 5 and 8 and was thoroughly enjoyed by all. The blu ray quality of this series is great, however you can see some grain in the picture although that is intentional. Story is great and the acting is top notch. Mostly an excellent product and experience. The navigation app was recently added to the app selection, works great. Considering the size of this watch, I have to say it's a phenomenal and fascinating smart product. I like the screen timeouts until you twist your wrist to see it. I use the speakerphone often while driving. The camera takes very decent pics, not like the phone though. I even use the tv/cable remote control app, works great. It was at first a novelty for me, but that's worn off and I'm getting used to having all the useful apps etc. right at my fingertips...err, wrist. Also love the weather showing up right on the watchface screen. Being able to verbally compose text messages to respond is awesome. I don't really use it as an exercise companion or fitness piece, but I know others who do and they like it. I think they need to make available a dedicated personal webpage to show your physical accomplishments in more detail though. There's definitely room for improvement...as great as this watch is, it's still sort of rudimentary in it's form, fashion and execution. But it's great for now and I look forward to the platform growing, expanding and maturing. Only my second personal tablet, but I have used and purchased many tablets for others and by far this has the worst battery life of any I have had experience with.\n",
        "\n",
        "That being said, there are optional battery saver and ultra battery saver taggles, which can extend the life (I have not tried ultra at this point) but then you lose the benefits of having this awesome state of the art device.\n",
        "\n",
        "As I tend to use this around the house and have a 5\" smartphone, battery life isnt the deal breaker that it could be. So be forewarned, you'll need to be close to a power outlet if you intend to use this moderately or greater. This washer has performed great. It's very silent, washes very well. This is the only way someone should view theses videos now. These discs boast stunning video and audio quality. It was like watching a whole new movie with all of the things you are able to see the the cleared up resolution. This game has great graphics and fun game modes. However the controls can be difficult to use especially when trying to complete submissions. I really didn't know what to expect from a CD from an artist who has been dead five years, but it turned out to be an excellent collections of songs for someone who has been, or is, a Michael Jackson fan. I would recommend it to everyone who likes him. This is a good power supply to buy if you are updating a desktop computer for gaming purposes. We bought a new graphics card, which required an upgrade in the power supply. I would recommend this to anyone who is upgrading their computer. I took a ton of pictures on my trip to Hawaii and didn't have to worry about running out of memory on the card. I expected a nice computer but was pleasantly surprised by how fast this computer is. Good CD for the price. Bought it for a gift and they really like it. I needed a monitor for my home office and this fits perfect. Great size and a perfect picture quality. Would definitely recommend. Leonardo Dicaprio best performance ever this movie is a must see i would call it Epic! I switched the whole family to H2O Wireless, bought more than 5 of them, the Sim card are easy to use, easy to install, great prices, great plans...monthly or pay as you go! The greatest thing is the best value that you can use the SIM on any unlock GSM phone or event the AT&amp;T phone not unlocked!!! Work great on my old AT&amp;T iphone 4S...too Great fun movie. Good for the whole family. Sure to please lego fans and not lego fans! Extras were a lot of fun as well. This compressed air duster came in very handy while I was travelling. On one trip I ahad the need to clean up my laptop and this product was inexpensive and compact. It did the job marvelously. A good game, but not the best cohesive storyline ever. it works as a story but not as well as Fall Of Cybertron. Bought so that it could be used on a white counter top and it's been doing that great. Good ergonomics and very easy to setup. I've tried several different ear buds for my iPhone 5 and these are my favorite. The seating in the ear is extremely comfortable and I love the ability to control the music without having to access the device. Broke the one that came with my tablet. This one works just as good as the factory one. sony always made a great product and this tv follows that trend When I selected this case, I was thinking in something small and elegant. I immediately liked the design. Haven't listened to this since college but it's still great. Good workout music as well. This is one of my all-time favorite Disney animated movies, and when it came out on DVD, I couldn't resist. I'm very happy about all the extras and the remastering of the color. I am so amazing on how beautiful and smooth this system runs! Traded in my laptop it wasnt working and I bought this instead and I'm very picky on what I keep and take back and I'm keeping this no doubt. Way worth $400 !!!!! If you have $400 buying this will be the best thing u ever owned!!!!! Great to hear music from my college years again. Enjoying the CD. Great to hear music from my high school years again. Enjoying the CD. powers look and feel great in battle...moral choices (play as a hero or evil but on the villainous side don't hold back and really put your powers to use!!), and most importantly, open-world game-play...these are the games strongest points Great to hear music from my high school years again. Enjoying the CD. The game was really fun to play through. The game is like GTA V, but located in Chicago plus all the cool hacking features. The game has ALOT of side missions, from driving contracts to hit contracts, you will find yourself doing the side missions more than playing the actual story. The story line was also really exciting! You can't go wrong with any Ubisoft game out there! The graphics are stunning in Watchdogs as well! Great price/performance. Very simple to set up and works seamlessly with iMac Time Machine. Very portable as well. good ear buds for all-around use. fit well and good sound. Purchased the case for my son's field trip to a water park...the phone had no damaged and was thrown in a pool and used for videos in a POOL! Great product.will be buying more cases perfect case for my 11 year-old son's iPod touch.. sturdy and protective. I have an older model printer that works fine. the only set back is that it is getting harder to find the color cartridge for my printer. but on this product itself. No issues. I think that this is one of the best super hero movies out there, really fun, great action and interesting characters. It is working great. It does need better instruction on how to install without a disk. A lot of new laptops do not have disk drives. perfect for my 11 year-old son to play games on long car rides! Purchased on an appliance sales tax weekend. After using a Samsung coupon I was able to get this fridge for just under $2k. It's a great fridge for the price. My only complaint is that the ice maker is very slow at dispensing the ice. Other than that, it's great! We often record our kid's track and field events as well as some of their teammates. The battery usually last the entire day and it does not get hot with continued use. We've had this laptop for a few weeks now it it works great! This worked perfectly out-of-the-box. Picture quality and Wi-Fi work perfectly. Only minor problem was that Netflix, vudu, hulu were not installed out of the box. A quick call to customer support, however, led to update online. It is one of the better movies out right now. Love how batman won't admit his faults. The whole movie is great This movie is a great followup to the first one. They incorporated other events that were happening during the slaying of the 300 spartans from the first movie. The blood pouring from the injured was a little to unreal for me but overall great movie! I just wish it was longer. got it for my son after his tablet stopped working. He loves the Vita, plays games with his friends.. Its a step up from the DS I enjoyed the movie, it was sad and uplifting at the end a memory card is a memory card works like it is supposed too for people willing to pay for their music this is a great cd! These cables have always worked good for me. I live close to a radio station &amp; I have to have the best cable I can find, to keep out unwanted signals. I really love this small speaker ,..Sound quality is pretty awesome and the one push Bass too is great. And the range is pretty awesome.. I enjoyed this movie from the time it came on until it ended, I have watched it twice and its still very funny to me great product! love that I get so many for the price! Cheap phone that does exactly what it is supposed to do. no extras but none needed for my use Fun game, great levels and challenges - I think more so then some of the other Lego themed games. Hours of fun. Occasional glitches with game freezing up during two player actions. Easy to install and fit very well. The price seems high for something that is supposed to be changed every 6 months. I bought this for a good low price a few weeks ago. Epic is a funny movie that the whole family can enjoy. We needed a smaller camera to take on vacation and after some research we chose the Nikon Coolpix L30. All of our pictures came out great no matter what the situation or the lighting conditions. The videos came out great as well. I love the 39' picture. The brightness of the picture is fantastic. I have been looking for this printer for some time. When I found it here for half price thought it was time to make it happen. I have had it for about a month. This printer has done everything it said it would do. Set up was a breeze, it prints fast, think ink consumption is o k ink is a little pricey, but it prints nicer than my other printer. I like this product. This is the second Linksys that we have bought, The other one was for DSL and this is for cable. It gets good reception and I don't lose signal. Nicely padded and lots of useful pockets. The zippers seem to be better than most bags/backpacks I've bad. The straps are comfortable. Need a auto feed printer for multiple pdf documents to be made... Compact in size was a major plus. Very satisfied. This is an easy to install and use security program. The on screen instructions and interface make it easy to ensure your computer is safe. Is RoboCop 2014 going to be considered a masterpiece like the 1987 film? Probably not. Is it a lot of fun? Yes! Don't compare this to the original and you might have a great time. A great cast gives great performances in this fun sci-fi action piece. There are some particularly good dramatic moments, too, and while there may be a nod or two to the original, this version stands on its own. Aside from skimpy extras and some iffy camerawork at times, this is a great release. Superb video and audio. Recommended. My spouse needed it to add to the rest of the seasons he has he has already watched it to make sure ok I like this ear buds I use then in the gym or when I go running it stay in your ear and don't fall out its real comfortable and sound it great -Great dash mount, gets the job done\n",
        "-Strong and will hold any phone weight\n",
        "-rotational head so phone can be viewed at an angle\n",
        "-Only drawback is the size, but if that doesn't matter then its perfectly fine I like it it keeps my computer cool. I like that I can adjust the angle and height of my computer when sitting on it  Fun for all ages. Even a COD type of gamer myself. If you're a fan of Workaholics, you should definitely pick up the Blu-Ray releases. They have excellent video and audio, and you get a lot of episodes for the price. You won't find many releases of quality programming for such a great price point. It is what you would expect, a good portable way to store files. There isn't really anything negative to be said. Great for kids and adults. Funny and great deal as a box set I needed this for school lessons and homework. It is smaller and lighter than a laptop. Matching McConaughey turns in the performance of his career thus far in this excellent film. This is a good blu-ray presentation, if a bit thin on extras. The cast is off the wall in what they do to get by. Comedy and Drama make for an excellent show. good deal especially for the sale price. costs less than a cup of coffee once a month The cast is off the wall in what they do to get by. Comedy and Drama make for an excellent show. a movie that really makes one think about race relations from all sides. I could watch this movie over and over and still cry when the shop owner fires his gun and thinks he killed the little girl. The cast is off the wall in what they do to get by. Comedy and Drama make for an excellent show. one of the best movies ever. and tim roth takes the cake as the ultimate bad guy. and liam isn't so hard to watch either. well made movie -Slim design, affordable and perfect for getting the charging job done\n",
        "-Nice \"saver mode\" feature once device is done charging\n",
        "-Effective and Sleek The combination of McConaughey and Harrelson made this show one of the best this past year. Highly recommend giving it a try. Excellent Purchase, thin lightweight and fast.\n",
        "Only con is of course all the bloatware that I have no use for. That can be mitigated however. This is one of the best tv shows ever made. If you have never seen it... start now. This is my 4th Dyson vacuum and only because I keep upgrading.\n",

        "This new one is my favorite of them all. The ball makes it easy to run around. Everything is simple and great to use. Sound quality is very good for both music and movies. Bass is very good as well. The only two things that are holding it back is the price and the very limited connections but I don't mind that because I wanted my setup to be simple. Bought this system for my 7 year old daughter and she loves it, so many options that she can play - either Wii pad or Wii remote, and user friendly for her. It gives very good directions on how to use the controls for each game, has great games for kids, including the ones I loved when I was growing up with Nintendo! I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY,WELL DONE LOVED THE OUTFITS THAT THEY WORE I personally like Samsung products and even more if its a tv. what i like about its the sound of it and the tv resolution,great picture screen. Needed a cover that could hopefully reduce the impact of a drop and not damage the case. So far it has lived up to its expectations i like garmin products they are easy to use. have a quick response. if given the choice to give up my cell phone or my garmin I would give up my cell phone. I like it that much. I bought this stand to use with a very heavy object, and it easily holds a lot of weight. If I'm not mistaken, it can hold 300 lbs. total amongst all the shelves (check the manufacturer site for the exact specs). You won't be disappointed with this stylish, sturdy stand. SMALL AND COMPACT\n",

        "LOVE THE DIFFERENT COLORS THAT THEY COME IN. GIVES YOU MORE OF A VARIETY Has lived up to the expectations for Face timing with new grandson and his parents. Also lets us stay in contact on the go instead of using SKYPE Braveheart is one of my favorite movies. I'm very pleased with the Blu-Ray version. It is a must-have for any movie collection. This Imac is fast, easy to set up, has just about everything I could want. If it had a dvd drive it would be perfect. However, I don't really use that feature much any more so I'm sure I can get by without it. Otherwise, it's great! Right off the start I had a good feeling about the game. I played 13 and I like it but it is not as complete as this one is. The defense, actually plays defense unlike in 13. I have been a fan for years and I truly think this has been the best experience in a while. I don't play much online so can't comment on that but otherwise, strongly recommend for any FIFA fan out there. This is a great product. Was so easy to install. I love the quality of this product. I love my iPhone 5c. I was able to get everything transferred from my old phone except my notes and ringtones. I love the battery life, it lasts alot longer than the iPhone 4. I am still figuring out the camera but love that I can take pictures farther away. I am probably not using everything to it's potential but will eventually. I did not buy this for fitness use and haven't used it for that. Other reviews say it is not accurate. Everything else is awesome. I love that I can send and receive texts from the watch. Battery life is great. Not a lot of apps, but don't really need a lot. I use a calendar app, calculator, weather, timer, stop watch and CNN news updates apps. Seeing the texts, emails and other notifications right on your wrist is the best part.\n",

        "I highly recommend getting a full body protection for the watch. It will get scratched easy. I first bought just a screen protector for it, but then realized that it started getting scratches on other parts, so then bought a full body protection This is a great tablet, runs apps and games flawlessly. Pretty good camera. I have dropped this case at least a couple of times with no issues. We went to a theme park with water attractions and it is waterproof, no issues there. I wish the case was a little more streamlined but overall I like it. I have not had any problems with it except that I have trouble hearing people talk sometimes. I wish everyone who travel's 3-4 times a week like I do could have one of these. this is the best phone I have ever had. Easy to use and I have an IMAC and the pictures are automatically transferred into IPHOTO which is a great thing! Fits nicely into my purse and I get wonderful reception. This TV is great if u are looking for a display that had a built in DVD player. It's a great product to purchase for a washer machine,it's universal for any washer machine to use and to install. I'll recommend it to anybody,to a friend, to a family member or to anyone that is looking for one for there washer machine. I went from a 12 inch jensen sub to this and I must say it was night and day difference. The bass was much cleaner, tighter, and less boomy. I am so glad I purchased this sub, I have no regrets. I loved this movie as a kid and still watched it on dvd from time to time over the years! I am very excited they have finally put it on blu ray and improved the picture and sound.

I loved this movie as a kid and still watched it on dvd from time to time over the years! I am very excited they have finally put it on blu ray and improved the picture and sound. That I can call it the lazy washer machine, cause you just have to put what u need to put to wash n let it run by itself, with out worrying about anything. My wife likes it and that's good for me to know. Over all its a great washer I'll will recommend it to anybody.. I really enjoyed this movie and the acting is great! I love Kate Winslet and she did another amazing job. This is my 3rd fitbit. I had a small one that hooked to clothing and I lost it. Then I had the force and it started falling apart so I mailed it back and they are reimbursing me. So, I have since bought the flex and although I miss the digital read out from the force, I do like the small band and the available color bands as accessories. I highly recommend this product as it is a huge motivator to stay in shape and get your daily steps in. A very solid wrestling game. Everyone in the home loves it. The DVDs burn as specified without any problems. Also, I got these on sale. I really enjoyed this game. Similar to the first game with the taking of photographs. The side missions can be frustrating as they end quickly thus affecting your reputation. Loved the roster of bosses you get to fight which expands greatly beyond that of the film. Haven't had a desire to pick it up again after finishing the main story, so replay value might not be high. This was a good movie. It was romantic and yet still had good drama. Great acting and good storyline. This charger works great and makes it easy to keep the phone charged when in the car or on the boat. Bought two of these recently, one for each of my parents. They use them differently but they both love it.\n",

I bought this for my husband for his 30th birthday. he was absolutely thrilled. he has yet to figure out all of the features but we have heard such wonderful things about the quality of the footage and cannot wait to capture some amazing moments with it. It is almost like fable for the XBOX 360. But is a little different. this sd card came free with our purchase of a GoPro, which was great because we needed a higher quality sd card to capture the quick, high resolution quality footage the GoPro provides. I'm a very good worker I'm always on time people like my transport people are always calling me to transpot I really like this unit and am happy I didn't go with something smaller These Heads are Great and work perfectly fine.\n",

        "snorkel on vacation. I just love my new camera because it has good zoom, and lots of pixels per image. I got frustrated the other day when I saw the adorable Bumble Bee, but I couldn't figure out how to get the camera into Macro mode. The obvious pressing of the 'tulip icon' just didn't work. Although I missed that image, I have lots of others that are great. I love the ease of use of this phone as well as size Love this product and would recommend it to others I have truly enjoyed playing this game. I'm not a gamer but I really like it I like this Blue-ray because the picture is excellent and very easy to operate. Very reliable, easy to use. Just plug it in and it's good to go. $10 PSN card is perfect for when you only need $10 for a game. It would be much better if the code was sent through email, so you don't have to wait for it to be shipped, but shipping is fast so it's only a minor negative. Very easy to use, plug it in and it's ready for file transfer right away with no problem.

        "WILL BUY AGAIN I bought this mouse pad because I needed a new one and this one was on clearance so I said why not. I do play games occasionally, and the best thing about this mouse pad to me is that i completely forget that it's actually there because my mouse glides smoothly over it. That's exactly how a mouse pad should be. I do have a gaming mouse too - the Logitech G5. Overall very satisfied with it. Great sound for my surround sound in my movie room This was the perfect gift to supplement the laptop computer we bought for our daughter;s college graduation. I knew it was her the moment i say it and the price was very reasonable. will definitely keep me coming back. It gets the job done. I definitely feel it is worth it as compared to paying extra for one that glows. Also, its detachability means I can use the USB to connect to my computer or to a car charger with a USB port. I bought it because I started having wrist problems using my mouse. It's comfortable, but you definitely realize that it's there. It meets the intended purpose. Hard to find part but got it and it works for the odd thing I needed it for I really like the feel of this mouse, but for some reason it doesn't seem to stay synced with my Lenovo ThinkPad X230, so I may have to end up returning it... Can't tell if it's an issue with my mouse or my laptop... plugs right in ready to use ,kids able to down load easily. I had to use this product to reconnect some things in my cousin's Xbox. So it worked but the fix didn't last long. So I don't know if it was because of this product or not but it worked. Great phone - it does everything you need it to do, its so user friendly, and has great features! Much better than my previous Droid phone. Loved the quality of the picture and ease of set up Great value for the price works just like it should . Chair is a little pricey comparatively but when you sit for hours at a time you need something comfortable. I work from home so spent a little extra doe to make sure I had a good office chair. I'm happy with the purchase. Easy to use\n",

        "Better than less expensive versions Watchdogs was probably the most hyped game in the history of hyping games. In development for over 5 years, presented to the public for three of those, it was hard for the PR machine not to hype the game. The problem with that is it grew too big for its own shoes, and when it finally released to the public many saw it as a let down. Personally, I was not disappointed in this game in the slightest. Yes, they graphically downgraded it compared to previous versions shown at E3 2 years ago, but the game is far from ugly. While it is lacking that next gen feel, the graphics are not a disappointment unless you really just want something to complain about. The rain effects are very impressive, there are moments when the day/night cycle can be jaw droppingly beautiful, the cars are modeled beautifully, and the character models are very well done. There are occasionally framerate dips after mission completion, but nothing game breaking. Sound quality could have been better, some cars sound excellent, some you can barely hear. The chatter from NPCs on the streets of Chicago is well written with splashes of humor everywhere, though the audio does suffer if you're the type to play with a headset, the voice-overs don't sound like they are blended into the game audio very well, its more like 2 separate audio feeds overlaid on one another, but again, a minor complaint there. The gameplay is solid, hacking CTOS objects never gets old, shooting mechanics are tight, missions are fun and do a good job of keeping things fresh, the side missions are varied and interesting, even the mini games and digital trips are worth going back for. Many people complain about the driving mechanics, but honestly they aren't that bad. It takes a second to get used to, but once you stop trying to go around every corner at maximum acceleration you'll enjoy it much more. I liked the game initially, but it wasn't until I put the camera in the cockpit and drove around the map for 2 hours that i really appreciated just how well built the game is. It may not be the full next gen experience we were \"promised,\" but Watchdogs does not disappoint. Try it for yourself, I highly recommend it. I love my Flex. I tap it, &amp; I know instantly if I'm 20, 40, 60, or 80% to my goal of 10,000 steps per day. It's comfortable, easy to charge, and it's practically water-proof. I feel like it's a pretty good value for its price. I didn't feel the more expensive models included enough based on my preferences to make it worth the upgrade. Sometimes I get a little lag, with would be a big no-no for gamers but it is working pretty well overall. -Great for construction professionals and outdorsman\n",
        "-Takes abuse and drops with ease\n",
        "-Water-resistant to an extent (able to withstand rain)\n",
        "-Solid, tough case that performs well with the belt clip light weight and good construction. did not work for my application It filters the water like it says it will ... Nothing to complicated .... I go not know how quickly it needs to be replaced, as I am just now trying it out ... So far, so good!! I'm happy with the HDMI cables. I paid a fair price. have watched this movie in regular format and 3d..3d version way better. The salesperson indicated that the AMD A10 chip isn't as good as the Intel i7 but it's been working well enough for our needs. I can't say much about the included keyboard and mouse as I bought wireless items to go with this. The original movie plot was better than this movie but because of technology today visually the action is better The HDMI cables seem to be working well with my smart tv and blue ray player set up. Great 3d viewing ..good product. would purchase more when needed Good early John Wayne movie. You get to see a younger, skinnier John which I enjoyed. Bought this because I was in need of a new laptop. It is running pretty well, the only complaints I've had so far are that the first couple of updates out of the box seem to be more difficult than they should be and I did have it freeze on me once where I had to press the power key to get it to reset.  great price great game play over all one of the games that shows off the ps4 power Bought it for my wife. She works in a warehouse while moving a lot of stuff. She's dropped it already once or twice, and there hasn't been any problem. It was very easy to get it connected and synced to the computer. Very pleased with the buy. But that's not surprising with Apple products. All in all this is a great bang for your buck. I really like it. great bundle at a great price. the box is really cool looking too. wish the unrated the wolverine was included as well but for the price you cant beat this bundle I'm happy with this purchase of full motion wall mount. It looks good on my wall with my new smart tv! love this show. highly recommend to folks who want to relive their childhood experiences or show to kids who are old enough. Overall great game, however the game can be glitchy at times. I purchased the game brand new and placed it in my PS3 and hasn't been removed since, however many times throughout game play it would freeze temporally (sometimes completely) and i would have to turn the system off and back on. Not sure if anyone else has had this issue, but i have the newer 320 GB model and this is the only game that has ever done this to me.... overall somewhat annoying but i love NFS games! As above whirlpool has the silverware basket in the door which I love. Would like to have had more instructions explaining the stopping and starting and emptying would have better understood. I thought something was wrong with the dishwasher. *See what's not so great... seems to require more time emptying and filling than time spent cleaning. Awesome game for kids and some adults, but can seem too easy at times. I am extremely happy with this purchase. It compliments my new LG smart tv. I don't need to ever get another phone because this phone has it all. Thanks for a great phone I love it I wanted a Surface from the first edition. However, I waited and am glad I did. The screen size is great, the tablet is light to carry, I love that it has ports, I am running Office 365 which rocks. I am very happy with it so far. These headphones are awesome to use if you're working out. They stay in place during crunches, sit-ups, running, and pull ups so I can have my music at all times to keep me going. I caught them on sale for $5 off so they were a great price. The sound quality is not excellent but decent for work out The price could be lower but this was actually the cheaper of the models and performs very well so far. Easy to use. Great TV for the price. Easy setup but no close caption on htmi Wife love this vacuum, so far so good. This vacuum replaced our Eureka (less than a year old) when the plastic tube cracked when it fell flat when the cord was accidentally pulled. I researched this hoover and we were happy with the results cleaning around the house and really does a good job picking up my golden retrievers hair as he sheds during this time of the year. More bang for the buck than the expensive models (i.e Dyson, Shark) This keyboard is at a great price, works great and I recommend. This is a basic wireless mouse, nothing more. I was anticipating a smaller portable mouse and was disappointed to see it's size. I still use it, but it's very cheap feeling. It only has 2 buttons and a scroll wheel, again, very basic. Now a days they have 5+ buttons and multi-directional scrolling. The USB IR adapter is stored in the base, which is nice, so you don't loose it. With the plastic feet, it slides virtually on all surfaces. Overall, it's not something I would write home about, but it would work if you're looking for something simple and love things made in China. Would recommend this product. Good price for a universal remote. Easy to set up and easy for everyone to use, including someone who had never used a universal remote before Hi, this was a really good CD for my wife. She told her mother to go get it herself. This was my first time purchasing a smart tv. The quality of this tv is incredible. GREAT FILM, TIES IN GREAT WITH THE ORIGINAL 300 MOVIE I loved the movie. I love John Wayne westerns and this was a good addition to my collection, especially in blu ray. This program is a must have for small business. Pricey but very necessary. Very nice quality stylus that is easy to use and durable. Have had it for about a month. Use it almost daily. I freeze real fruit on a cookie sheet 1st, then bag it. I grab a hand full of each fruit, put it in, add some fruit juice and blend it for wonderful, SMOOTH smoothies. NO ice. LOVE IT! Blades areSHARP so be careful not to touch them. I have loved The Boondocks since it was a strip in the comics in the newspaper. The show is even better. Sad that this is the final season. Product is thinner than other stylus pens which makes it easier to pinpoint what you use it on. This monitor was perfect for my small business. I highly recommend the product. I use these everyday at WORk, they work flawlessly. I get close to 200' range out of these inside our warehouse. We have been waiting for this movie to come out for months. The boys loved it in the theatre and now love that they can watch it whenever they want. Its a great charger....................................................................................................................................................................... This is a great TV with an excellent picture. 8 different picture settings allows for easily switching picture for a movie. If you watch a movie too clear and smooth of a picture it's like you are at the set with them. Motion pictures aren't meant to be watched that way, but it's a simple fix. The color is bright and nice. I use external speakers so sound is not an issue. Internet connectivity is somewhat disappointing as it lacks the speed of my other devises. Web OS is awesome. The magic remote I have needs to be re-registered after resetting it every time the tv is off which is frustrating. I called LG and they are sending me a new remote. I hope this works as I really like this TV and got it on sale. One more HDMI would have been nice. As stated above, the weather dictates reception, which is not the system's fault. If you are a tv fanatic, this is not for you. I only watch a few programs, so it is much cheaper than cable tv. It is good for the value of money. Reliable and works well. This wall mount was easy to install and I am very confident it will support the TV. i am a big harry potter fan and could not wait for all the movies to come out on dvd. loved it My son loves that these give his characters extra powers, moves, etc on the Disney Infinity game. Nobody likes it when the printer is out of ink, but these easy to use cartridges make it quick and neat to get going again. Nobody likes it when the printer is out of ink, but these cartridges are easy to use and have good print quality. This case is very strong and does extend the life of the battery. I have movies on my tablet that took up a lot of memory on my tablet. Having the memory card, I don't have to erase any and have plenty of storage for everything I bought (2) sets of these cameras for LH03081TC4W \"Lorex - 8-Channel, 4-Camera Indoor/Outdoor Wireless DVR Security System\" This computer was exactly what I needed for my small business. Reliable, great price and stylish. This device works great. No more waiting for the Xbox to load top usr apps I have three of these charge cables now and i love them all. This item is great, works fine for now. I really like that it is portable and gets you anywhere without worrying about your shoulder dislocation. The battery is great,and so is its speed. I love it a lot, am happy with it. I bought 2 one for my phone and one to charge my controller. They both work perfectly. Haven't watched the full season yet but from what I watched its good. This is my second pair of these. Look great and are easy to set up. Wish they came in singles. I have only used the cord once, but so far it seems to satisfy all my needs. So far I love my IPOD. I t is so versatile and works well in my car. I now plan to cancel my XM Radio service. I enjoyed the ease to get this tv set up and the picture was amazing. I switched from a plasma tv and noticed a huge difference from the get go. Sports viewing is night and day...and I plan to enjoy this tv for a long time. i like the idea of being able to choose the color, i want. it fits well, it does not slide off like some cases. Better than using your credit card and makes a great gift. I love John Wayne movies, especially westerns. Any John Wayne fans will love it. Wolfenstein: The New Order is a fantastic game overall and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good shooter with a great story. The AI can be mindless at times but it doesn't really take away from the action or story. Got this as a gift for my parents. Very easy set up and easy to navigate. Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for easy access to online for their tv. I use this while mountain biking and just whenever I feel like it. It really is an amazing piece of equipment. I have had this product for about a month now and have not one complaint. I primarily use it when I am cruising my neighborhood/beach place it in my basket and it gives off enough sound and bass that my bf riding next to me can hear it clear as well. I brought it on a family vacation and down to the lake it was the hit all weekend long. Got nothing but compliments. I have recommended it and I had friends that bought them. I was really impressed with this movie. The Rock's intensity as a man out for revenge really held this together. Definitely check this out. This is an awesome product especially if you have Amazon prime. Screen size is a little small but very portable. Called support for minor glitch tweaking picture during set up. Fantastic plasma picture quality. Perfect for basement, since plasmas look better in a darker room. Plasma look is more realistic and crisp versus LED. Black is black, not gray. Of course, use HDMI cables and dynamic look during set up and you are good to go. Blu ray 1080p picture is superb. TV speakers are average at best. Connect to an external sound source, reciever/sound bar, for true theater expierence. Added bonus: TV looks good and it swivels. One negative, only two HDMI ports. I've used several Rocketfish-branded devices. They perform at least as well as the official Apple devices at a lower cost. I wish the cable itself was a little longer. I would make it easer to anchor the adapter to something so it doesn't put as much stress on the port. Excellent customer service when I bought this ipod. Love that it has a mute setting and I can use it with online gaming. I am happy with this purchase. This was a little steep in price but the sound quality is excellent. Excellent product quality, great design, lightning plug plastic enclosure is a little bit bigger than the original so it does not fit in some iphone protectors This game is a lot of fun and I really like the story line. this movie is great i watch it over and over again Phillip Phillips album is amazing. I would recommend it. Not sure about long term durability since I haven't used them for long.\n",
        "Very comfortable in the ear. My daughters and I love the songs from the soundtrack as much as the movie. Next Gen fighter is here, with EA's UFC. This game has a new feel to it, when it comes to the previous UFC titles. It feel's like a hybrid of EA's MMA and and normal UFC game. It takes a little time to get use to the controls, but once you do it's on. This game tries really hard to make it feel realistic, and does a great job. You need to think game plan when fighting, coming out swing may land you a big hit, but if it doesn't, you're done son. Trying to button smash in this game, will empty your character's gas tank fast, leaving you to the wolves. You have to keep your health and stamina on your mind at all times during the fight. Let a limb get hurt too much, and you'll be finished off, or can't punch/kick as well. The new career mode had you fighting for the Ultimate Fighter title, as you work your way into the UFC. And of course you can take your skills online, and prove what you're made of. This drive has, so far, been great. It's fast, burns flawlessly, and plays movies quietly. Nice gaming experience. Excellent play level design. It's very light and handy when compared to iPad. Screen is not that great as it's not a retina. I purchased this memory card to save pictures and video from my cell phone. Easy to install and retrive pictures and videos from . Great tablet for the price. Not as nice as a Nexus tablet, but pretty close. I wish you could uninstall the pre-installed software instead of just disable. I did notice the touch is slightly off near the edges.. maybe its just the angle at which I use it. The resolution isn't as high as the Pro tablets, but you can't tell unless you're doing some serious gaming. Easy to hold, not slippery like others... I can hold with one hand and support with fingers for hours at a time without noticing. Its a great product and I recommend it to friends! Overall very pleased with the case. It works for my convenience. Bought this for online gaming. My room is opposite end of at 1200 square foot house with several walls in between, I get great signal strength. Just purchased this TV and I'm loving it already. What a great picture quality and sound. Really intuitive to set up and am loving the features, worth the cost and investment! It's not only beautiful it's functional!\n",
        "I get lots of compliments on this case!\n",
        "\n",
        "Since this case is a little thicker, or the hole is smaller than my last protective case, I did have to buy a new connecting cord to play music in my car since the vehicle doesn't have blue tooth. But they are easy to find at any store This phone is exactly what I've been looking for - all the features of the S3 and S4, larger and more beautiful screen, the stylus is a nice addition for occasional use, and battery life is fantastic.\n",
        "In fact, I get better battery life on the Note 3 than my S4.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the biggest issue I think people might have is the size of the phone - it is large. However, after about 2-3 days, I no longer noticed the size and now find my s4 to be tiny...and iphones? TEENY TINY. i am very happy with it. i use it mostly to listen to the fm radio and it comes in clear. i have also used the cd player and it works fine. Hack your way around the city of Chicago in this new open world sandbox. Has a very similar feel to GTA, but it is not GTA. If you just wanna run around and cause chaos this may not be for you. Running around like a madman will hurt your Rep, you're a vigilante, not a bad guy. Use your hacking skills to uncover mysteries around the city, and help bring justice to those who killed your niece. Duracell Batteries Never fails me when I need to use them. Decided to dump all my dvd boxes and put them into books. this book held them all and then some. Awesome product. everything is nice and organized now. Awesome AC checked out a few before actually buying this one. I've only had it for a day but it works very good, and its very quiet. the reviews helped me out a lot in choosing it. 2 thumbs up This has been a great laptop for home use by my family. It has a lot of features that are easily accessible. We love the touchscreen option too. It has many applications for use by everyone. We are glad we chose this for the family laptop. We do recommend this product. I waited to upgtrade so I could get this phone and it was worth it! Great size, quality and battery life!! Great TV for my kids room, can connect the laptop. Cheap for its size and capabilities! Bought this for my car, so I could easily plug in friend's players into my car stereo. Love the length because it reaches my back seat easily while still being plugged into my car. Story is told through 3 protagonists that want to be richer. Why not use intel to get gold? Whenever riches are involved, there is bound to be trouble. Shield is working really well. I have had several people tell me I need to have a screen protector on it and I tell them I already have one. They are impressed that they are not able to tell it is on there. Tablet is working out well. Only issue so far are the buttons are so sensitive that I log myself out of the pages I am on if I barely touch any other button. Works really well, was really easy to install in truck Seems to be holding up to all the travel and items in the bag.  Great trilogy but felt obligated to tie things together in Goldmember. Mike Myers does it again with one of his popular portrayal Austin Powers. this product is good, easy to carry, light weight, good for SLR cameras This is a great memory card at a great price. I have been snapping a lot of pictures and have had no problems thus far! It was perfect for my trip. It held everything that was needed for the recorder. Everything is great about this modem. I have it hooked to my airport extreme Wireless N throughout the house and it works great with my Brighthouse Cable (60mbps). Only issue is the service that Brighthouse isnt always up to the advertised speed as with all cable providers. This is a great way to save $6 a month. I have had cable with Comcast, Time Warner, Charter and now Brighthouse. This is the best modem so far compared to any that they provide. It was easy to charge and connect to the recorder. The camcorder was easy to setup, charge and use. I would highly recommend it. Bought this card for my girl's new Galaxy S5. She had a 2gb one form another vendor but it failed. Luckily all the photos she had were backed up on the computer. I have used this brand since my Galaxy S2 and S3. Now I have a Note 3 with a 64gb in it. It's the only card I will use and the only one you should too! The performance of this SD card is very good. I use this card with my Sony Alpha A6000 camera. I take a lot of pictures with moving objects. The performance of this SD is working as advertised. Up until now, I have not experienced any latency during write operation from the camera to the SD card. Overall, I am very satisfied with this SD card. Really good movie! Ol' clints growling does get on my nerves tho! Good movie for the price It was easy to install and very well worth my money. Easy to transfer photos to your phone via Wi-Fi. Took bright and vivid photos under water! This film brought me back to my childhood and I had a blast sharing this love of Lego with my little brother. To laugh like a kid again is worth the price of this film. I strongly recommend people of all ages to get and watch this film. Great storage for the price. The only negative I can see is the lever These are decent headphones for anyone who is looking for buds with a mic. They are a little expensive but that is because you are buying a name brand product. They are really durable and water resistant. I have already accidentally washed these headphones and they still work(though I wouldn't recommend washing your headphones). I got a pair of these on sale and so far I'm quite pleased with them. I've found the ability to hook my smartphone inline and listen to streaming content as well as take calls without removing the headset is very convenient. The sound is great. I now hear things in games that I had never heard before. I've also been told that my voice, both over the phone and over the computer, is very clear. The padding around the ears is very comfortable and it's easy to wear it for long periods of time. The only issue I have, and I consider it a minor one, is that it takes a bit of adjustment if I'm wearing my glasses; the glasses tend to get pushed in from the sides and I either feel it there or on the bridge of my nose if the glasses get tilted. I can always get them adjusted so they're comfortable, but a simple design change with the headset would make that adjusting unnecessary. Overall though, I really like these, and I wouldn't hesitate to buy another pair. Loved watching this in 3d with the family. Especially with our new 3d smart tv and surround sound. We've watched it more than once. Just wish the blue ray 3d movies weren't so expensive. A must buy!!! Great movie! Super cheap! and even the case made me want the movie even more Haven't used this a lot as of yet but have been satisfied with it so far. For someone who used to point-and-shoot cameras as well as cellphone cameras, this camera is very intuitive. Most of the built-in auto-settings produces picture quality that I am looking for. The lighting and the colors come out just right.\n",
        "I take a lot of pictures of moving objects. Having this camera is a big plus for me. The speed of the auto-focus and auto-tracking the object really helps for novice users taking pictures of moving objects. Overall, I am satisfied with this camera. Few movies tell about World War I. The need for horses existed, they were treated badly on the front lines. This changed as did the relationship between American and German soldiers. Soldiers on either side are depicted as being inhumane during war. As the movie progresses this perspective is changed. great mix of two classic genres with a story built to keep attention Inks great, works for my HP Phototsmart printer, wish it could be cheaper. This movie had a big influence in me. This was one of the first movies to show a geek as the hero of the story and that computers are cool. The extras are a must for any fan. Even now that nuclear war seems not to be an immediate concern as it was during the 80's the final 20 minutes of the movies will shock you how close we were to the end. Super funny movie must own for any collection! You wont regret! great multiplayer game for family and of all ages! Purchased 1 month ago. Better picture than I hoped for, even in standard HD. Netflix UHD is awesome. On screen channel guide needs improvement with my Xfinity X1 STB. Sound is satisfactory but nothing special. Web browser works great. Screen mirroring (wireless display) with my phone is flawless. I have a galley kichen, so when I cook pots and pans dishes if not washed right away makes it cluttered quickly! With my new dishwasher\n",
        "I can put them in the dishwasher and my counters are clear and I don't have to hand wash after fixing meals. Less time on my feet and more time to spend with family and friends and enjoy the meals I make!! 3 great movies at a super cheap price! Enough said Still experiencing this cartridge but so far so good lets see how long this ones last!!! awesome feature of mario design on controller looks custom There is a lot of good songs on this cd. She always has good CDs. very pleased with overall look and design. awesome durability Good enough headphones for daily use I use them at work daily and for running choose the right cover for your ear if you go too big your eardrum would be hurting other than that this headphones are good for daily use!!! Seems to be working well. Have not had any issues with it. Brantley gilbert has a lot of new songs that rock on here. My boyfriend and I were looking for a compromise... he wanted a simple toaster and i wanted the toaster oven... as soon as i seen this... we were sold! I Love the big phone with the big numbers. It is easy to use. Sound is very clear. Also like the 2 cordless phones and if you can not find a phone there is a tracker on the big phone for easy finding. Eric church has a lot of new good songs on this album. It was easy to install and setup.\n",
        "Works well with my Onkyo receiver and Vizio TV.\n",
        "I use this player primarily for watching 3D movies and it delivers on that.\n",
        "I've tested the DLNA abilities, and it works, but better options exist for that such as apps on my Android phone. We use this fan in my little girl's room. It's very small/compact, but is so powerful! We would buy this product again! Needed this for traveling and works well in the car. The game is definitely a worthy successor to other Infamous titles, however it is also much shorter than 1 or 2. The protagonist is interesting, though definitely immature compared to Cole from 1 &amp; 2. Cool design, lightweight but sturdy, good available features, heats up fast &amp; enough for normal ironing. Great buy at this price. A great movie. It's an older movie but love Clint Eastwood. It's a simple device that does what you would think it'd do. A little expensive, but I've had no problems with it, so I suppose it's worth it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Very happy over all. The system is great and I recommend it whole-heartedly. My biggest gripe is with the controller. It simply dies too quickly, requiring recharge I'd say about ever 6 hours or regular gameplay. Not worth the price tag!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A very good movie. Had to buy it because I love John Wayne. It's a great product, with the right amount of options on the offering. Heating happens uniformly. Not too heavy either. I am using it for the last 4 months with no issue to report. Great buy at this price. Great sound and easy to sync to Bluetooth. It also is compact and travels well. We bought an LG pair last December and are very happy so far. They were rated to be high quality and low need for repair, and so far there have been no issues. They look great if you like the graphite look, they are quiet and are packed with features. Clothes come out clean and smelling great. I saw this movie in the theater and loved it so much I bought it when it got released. Very funny!!! This TV has a great picture and also comes with internet TV. As I said, good focus close and mid range, even good focus long distances when only taking stills but on long range videos (I was shooting a video of the Blue Angels from say a half mile away) it goes out of focus randomly and won't refocus until you end the video. Also unless you go into the select mode specific for it, you cannot take stills while shooting videos. I do like the Rec. Button avail from any mode though, makes changing from stills to video easy and fairly quick so you don't miss your chance at whatever you're shooting. Also the battery symbol is not accurate when running low, it goes straight from half to low, even though there is another notch available. I would recommend this purchase. I like the sleek design that makes it look more professional for my setup when I am DJing. It has less wires and is compatible with my Mac Book Pro A wonderful catalog from three outstanding bandleaders. I tried a few different brands, these are so much better sounding than Beats and so much better priced. They sound amazing for only being $200. I'm a fan of Sol Republic now. Thinking of getting a pair of their in ear headphones as well. I bought this CD because I love the artist. Great songs at a great price. Own 3 of these no problems ever. Works great. Cleans perfectly. Would definitley buy again Own three of these in different houses , Work fantastic . Never a problem I purchased this iPod to be used as social media hub on a restaurant, and it works great Great for outdoor photography. I use it mostly for landscapes. Make the sky so blue and the clouds stand out. Love it. With this alarm clock you almost have no choice but to get up. A good long cord for charging your apple products. You can shorten the cord if you like. Excellent buy. Easy to connect &amp; use, reliable &amp; sturdy. I am using it for the last 6 months &amp; still going strong. A great buy at this price. Great durable cover for an IPhone. It does occasionally bubble, however, ot bad enough to cause a real issue. wish i had spent the 10 extra dollars and gotten a new disc. I always put a UV filter on all my lenses. They provide great protection for all your lenses. This filter is great and a great value. Highly recommend. Loving this album! As I said, it's another knockout album by Mastodon! My only gripe with the album is a small part at the end of one of the tracks....unlike anything Mastodon has done before, and I hope it will be the last time for them. Got this bag on sale, a plus. Tons of room. Sectioned for lenses and accessories. Easy to carry and get into. A zippered section that expands the size of the bag. Love it. For the price, this TV is pretty good.\n",
        "Picture quality, refresh rate and all that were decent.\n",
        "Only complaint is that speakers are pretty weak, so you might need to get a sound system or soundbar. The agent called me within 10 minutes of my online chat inquiry with tech support, and the problem was solved in less than 10 minutes when the call began. Very easy to setup. A couple of steps and I was already to go. Prints fast. The Apple TV is a terrific addition to any home that is primarily utilizing Apple products (i.e. iPod, iPhone, Mac computers, etc.) Allows for the easy streaming of content from Apple gadgets to the big screen via the AirPlay feature, with seamless integration. I only use for personal usage so it works well for the things I print. If you want a richer, darker black, buy the next quality of black up from this one. This is the economy cartridge. this printer is so very much better than the other one. I LOVE it! this cd was awesome every song on the cd blessed me It was a perfect present for my son. His friends and him are having the best summer because of the game!!!! This collection is great all movies are action packed and on blu ray so it makes the experience even better. Definitely a must buy if u like the dark gritty vampire flicks. You will have space to store your nintendo 3DS and 6 more games. Powerfull sound for a small speaker and good battery life. Bluetooth range is 30 feet or so. Not bad ...... Good product for my teenager who is not the most careful with his things. Works great and serves my need for its use. I don't do a bunch of printing or printing of photos. If quality is what you want, buy the next one up from the economy cartridge such as this one. It is a good (maybe the only one) case for Nintendo 2DS It is a very creative game. You always can find something new. This PRODUCT is light weight large screen good picture, will buy another. It's a good Disney game. If your kids like the Disney stuff, probally, they will enjoy. This band is defiantly going places in their future, this album is truly amazing, best hard rock album out right now. This is a great movie. If you haven't seen it come on its like $7.00! The bonus features alone make it a worthy purchase. Good TV. Has a ton of features. The remote is awesome. Fast service too bad that the entire order could not be filled. I have had a lot of family members who use UPSs from APC and have had good customer support when needed. APC makes a very good product and it is very easy to setup. The only down fall to it, is that I have two computers powered off of it and only one can be shut down if the power goes out. It would be nice if they shipped it with a small onboard webserver like printers do and allow you to have a piece of software that monitors it. Otherwise it is a great product. These glasses are great. And when you're not looking at the screen they don't obstruct your normal vision so I find myself getting up to get something and the glasses keep disconnecting and re connecting which shows up on the TV. Just remember to leave them on the couch and you should love them. This is my third I phone and each time they seem to get it right. Use to have a Samasung Galaxy Tab 2.0, but traded it in to get iPad Air.\n",

        "I like that its an easy to use OS. less confusing then Android but also less customizable. Very light weight, and the screen resolution is beautiful. Lots of space for movies on the go.\n",
        "\n",
        "Its costs too much, no doubt about that. But I've never been disappointed with apple products, and I can easily work their iOS system better than andriod. The overall game is great! The plot was a little slow and didn't make you really feel for the characters or what happens to them. After a while, there gets to be a low in the game as there's only so many crimes to stop or gangs to bust up before you get the feeling like your going thru the motions.\n",
        "\n",
        "The good stuff outweighs the bad, so it still ranks pretty high! Having another player \"hack\" into your game and try to steal your data is fun and makes the line between solo and multi player very thin. Game controls are smooth and easy to use. I would say this movie is like saving private Ryan in a way, the fire fights seems pretty realistic and it's so intense just to watch what happens next. I would recommend this movie if u liked saving private ryan. So I decided to get a home theater system. I read the reviews settled with this puppy.\n",

        "Hooking it up was a little painful. But once you place the speaker wires where it needs to be everything else is a breeze.\n",

        "My first week with this system I tweaked and tweaked it like there was no tomorrow. I enjoyed the different settings. Never had the right sweet spot sound though. It still had great sound just not the oyea! feeling.\n",
        "\n",
        "Not completely satisfied with the tweaking I returned this product for the bose gs cinemate II thinking that it was the magic bullet for my search for the perfect home theater. It cost me an extra $180 for the Bose system. .. Let me tell you something. I had so much high hopes for the Bose. You always hear you can't go wrong going with bose. But bottom line the Cinemate didn't fill up the room as much as the Yamaha did. Just to add Cinemate is a 2.1 not a 5.1 so I am guessing that was the big difference. The extra $180 for the bose was not justified through the sound quality which I had expected even if it was 2.1\n",
        "\n",
        "So after weighing in the plus and minuses which took only a good 5 mins to do. I knew I bought the wrong product so I decided to go back to the store and return the Cinemate for the Yamaha again.\n",

        "Knowing I was close to my goal I was just missing the one thing but didn't know what. So before hooking it back up I did more research on best placements of the speakers. One thing I did different this time is lower the Front and Left Speaker to ear level before it was above two to three feet above ear level. And also I put the center speaker below tv which before was above the tv by 4 feet. I found out my previous setup was not properly setup. the center and fronts were separated to much. The rule of thumb was not to have the center speaker and front left and right speaker separated by no more than 18\" apart vertically. I did just that and guess what. I was in sweet spot heaven!!! The quality was spot on. Everything came alive. I put it through the works. Music, movies regular cable tv. I was amazed how awesome it got by just placing them in the right place. Closed my eyes and seriously I sometimes couldn't tell where the music was coming from.\n",

        "For the price its a solid solid buy. If you already are beyond the beginner stage of your home theater setups this may not be for you. But if you are like me and starting off and need the quality sound with the right price this is it. This cable was just what I needed. I am so pleased with the cable wire.  Would recommend this for anyone that requires a large screen size. No need to buy water bottles anymore. Easy to use. Short length makes it perfect - means that i don't have a bunch of wire to roll up and dangle behind the TV, Cable Box, DVD player, game console, etc. Ever since my first flat screen I've been very happy with samsung TVs. Their picture quality is in my opinion for LEDs the best. Great way to individualize your own controller. Standard quality playstation product. excellent product at a great price. i highly recommend I installed this myself on my CRZ, and it was really easy and took less than an hour. I was skeptical because of the price, but very pleased with the result. The nighttime vision isn't fantastic, but it does the job. Daytime is just as good as Honda's OEM cameras. I didn't want a bulky case. This one fits the tablet perfectly. This memory stick is exactly what I expected. Not a lot more to say. Inexpensive, works well. Compact, easy to set up and use. Great price. Couldn't ask for more. Got this to replace my 2011 MacBook pro and while I had updated the memory and installed an SSD in that one, this one feels so much faster. There's also no comparison with the Retina display vs. the older one.\n",
        "\n",
        "This one does get noticeably warmer and if using it in your lap you have to make sure the cooling vents on the bottom are not obstructed. I have Zagg protectors on all of our devices. Excellent screen protection. Bought one of these for charging my phone in my vehicle several months ago - other brands seemed to wear out and had to be replaced within a short time, but this one still going strong - so i got one for my wife's vehicle. This is a great TV for a small room or bedroom. It is light weight and easy to use. It is definitely an enjoyable game. I had too high of expectations for this game when buying it, so I could only give it 4 stars, and also because I can only seem to play it in 2 hour sittings. It is definitely worth giving it a shot, especially If you like GTA. Great value. No complaints. Fits well and cord management strap is useful. Allows me to use my Thunderbolt display with my MacBook Pro Retina. It's actually a little easier to remove the power connector from the MacBook since it sticks out a bit more than the old Magsafe adapter. It's a good option if you need a DS and don't want to spend $60 extra. Overall I really like these cases, but the matte black color tends to leave finger/hand prints wherever I grab it. The glossy finishes don't seem to have this problem so I would probably suggest one of those colors. Was purchased for my wife, She loves it.\n",
        "Great picture, clear and bright.\n",
        "Up graded her cable box to HD and she really likes the full screen display. Great remote. Easy to connect and easy to use. Good value for the price We needed them to video tgings wjile constantly moving. There were great for our organization. Case is the most durable one I've found. Yeah it has its voice flaws, but its water and filth proof which is a key feature in my book. The lifeproof one falls apart and I don't think it has the crush resistance this one does. This high yield toner cartridge is the reason I bought this printer. It is easy to install and lasts a long time. The episodes were all original. The flow of the season moved along nicely. The best movie that I have seen in a while. The characters are the best at their game. Being that this is my 1st NETGEAR router, I am pleased with how easy it was to set up and how far the bandwith reaches throughout the house. I'd recommend this router to anyone. I got this for my husband originally but I just love using it. It's compact yet not too small! I was a little skeptical about this at first, thinking it was not a necessity, but now I think everyone should have it. You don't need to turn on an extra device to stream Netflix and You Tube. Can just use your iphone or ipad. It's easy enough for even my mother to use. Good value HDMI cable for our Blue Ray player. No need for high priced versions. If you've not seen the tv you will like it better. The installation process is a piece of cake. This product requires paying annual subscription fees which is OK by me to ensure I keep the most current version in my system. This is our first year trying this but so far no issues. I would not recommend this because I do not have enough experience with the product yet. I really enjoy this soda... i love my soda stream and really enjoy this flavor as well as the diet lemon lime! I highly recommend it!!! Low profile design makes it less obtrusive than other types/brands. Great ,music, great show, fun to watch especially if you've never been to a Zombie show. This is a good heart rate monitor for the price. I have been using for about a month and can easily check my heart rate during cardio exercises to be sure I am hitting my target rate, but not exceeding it. If you order one, you might want to get extra straps. it fits good and stays closed when not in use with the magnetic latch Very easy set up. Just plug in the Bluetooth dongle and it was ready to go. Good overall product for the value. It's small and compact and it can be placed right on arm of chair that I'm sitting on outside. For someone who's not tech savvy it is easy to use. Very comfortable. Happy with it so far. My last pad wore out, so I hope this one lasts longer. Great Wireless mouse for the price. Lots of programming options making it very versitile. Like the feel of it in my hand. I bought this SD Card because I knew it would work This game is awesome. I had the 2010 version with my PS3. There are a bunch of upgrades to this game that make it better than the previous version I have played. This case is very durable and is a great case for any tablet. I have only played this game a few time so far and the graphics and game play are awesome. Only issue is I can't seem to figure out how to keep the ball down when taking a shot on goal. Hoping to figure out soon. Still fun to play. A shootout victory is still a victory. This sleak iPad case is essential for your device! Absolutely the best value out there. For a small user like me, it really does cost $7/month to operate it with the option to go up to any amount, just adding minutes as I go. A really great introductory smartphone and maybe good enough for most. Bought this so I could have two controllers for my PS4. The controller takes no time to connect to the system. Only issue is the new controllers seem to run out of battery a little faster then previous versions. But it also has more functions and lights. Recommend purchasing pads for the knobs on the controller. Have read some other reviews were people have wore the padding off already under heavy use. This case is very durable and is great for any tablet. I like Clint Eastwood movis, have a bunch, and this is just what I expected, Except in Blu-Ray it is so much better. I had these in the original DVD version, but Blu-Ray clears them up.\n",
        "On seperate discs too!\n",
        "Well, I can't complain, I like them. Replaced my Cisco with this for WiFi and transition to Apple. Backups are always available if needed.\n",
        "Use it on my iMac, Mac Air and a Dell Win 7. Saved my wife's phone from extinction. She finally lives with a fully charged phone My duaghter is satisfied with the laptop. So far seems to be fast with no bugs. Touch screen works well. The audio through the head phone jack not as high quality as other computers we have had. Overall, very happy with purchase. Pixar did it again. Graphics are amazing, storyline keeps kids and adults alike entertained. I didn't know that a trac phone could be so nice to have. Once I get used to using it, I know I will love it! The first movie was better and this one had lots of action but it was similar to the first movie so you knew what to expect which lack surprises. The acting was great and if you like the series, then you will like this movie. I think it's a good second movie and it helps the series along and sets up for the third movie. I wanted something smaller than a laptop. This is light, compact, and allows me to do spreadsheets. I have not had any issues with the tablet. looking forward to hearing back from contact so that we can determine which tv to purchase and when it can be installed, waiting for a call back. GREAT TV FOR THE PRICE. PURCHASED FOR MY 5 YEAR OLD GRANDSON. IT WAS WONDERFUL I purchased this drive and installed it in my brand new PS4. It took very little effort to install in the PS4. Since I had a friend who had already done the same thing and had the PS4 data ready for install it to no time at all for me to get up and running with the PS4. Tons of storage for today's gaming options. Fantastic tv for the price. It provides crystal clear picture and colors that makes it a great tv. Wish it had more connections for HDMI Great tablet for the kids. Keeps them entertained.. Another nicely done action thriller from Russell Crowe. I had the old DVD version, but this new Blu-Ray version is much better in clearity.\n",
        "And it takes up so much less space on the shelf.\n",
        "Well woth the few dollars spent on the movie.\n",
        "Rent it twice and you could have bought it. Nice screen. Great to surf and email. Plenty of apps available. I have been a longtime PS owner and user and this is by far the best product they have released. The set up is easy and you are ready to play in no time at all. The graphics on the games are amazing. I have only had the PS4 about a month and have barely been able to unlock all the possibilities with this device/ Does the job as expected. I think it was over-priced for what it is. It's a nice game the bought a new fresh idea of technology use devices. Great movie. Cant say if it follows the original story but I liked it This season was great! Somehow I got a little lost and I am going to watch the previous season again and then this one again to see where I missed something. I did not enjoy the season finale and cannot wait to see what unfolds next season. But I always recommend lost girl, it's a fantastic show full of surprises and interesting things! I used a couple of different brands on a Go Pro Hero and with the casing it can get very hot for the card, and they started to fail on recording, this Sandisk has been on the worst conditions so far and has never give any trouble. Superb value for the price These are 4 for the best Steve McQueen movies, each on a seperate disc. I had them all on regular DVD ( I donate them to a library) but Blu-Ray is much clearer, crisper, and the take up less room than the old DVD's (I have around 2000 movies and space is a concern.)\n",
        "All great movies Recommemded Highly. I like it because it has enough phones for my house it is easy to set up and ue After researching many different units I finally narrowed my search down to the Polar FT4. I liked the value for price and its ease of use. I've used the FT4 for over a month now and had absolutely no problems with it. The only downside to it I've found so far is the that I can't upload my workout data to my smart phone. Other than that I like the product. I personally haven't been able to play this game yet, since the kids (7 - 15, boys and girls) have taken over the Wii U. They have been having loads of fun. Up until I bought this game for them, they'd regularly play Mario Kart Wii, so this was a welcome addition. The only thing they complain about is that I've locked down Internet access on their profiles, so they can't race over the network, while they could with Mario Kart Wii. I may be able to change this, but haven't looked into it yet. They're having fun playing each other for now. loved the ease of getting online and not having to use my credit card great classic... bought it as a replacement to the first one my kids lost great movie for the kiddos.......................they loved it Great speaker love it good for cookouts and just hanging out with the family wanting to hear some good playing music thank tdk for making such a good speaker. excellent product for the price and i highly recommend I wanted to replace my tablet (mostly used for ebooks and email) as well as my laptop (I need to run work software that tablets cannot support). I was feeling like the poster child for Microsoft's pitch on this product.\n",

        "After a week, no regrets. I can run my work apps and exe files, and at the end of the day, I pop into bed and browse email, play games, and watch videos.\n",
        "\n",
        "Also, this is Xbox One supported for the Xbox Glass app, which is great for browsing Netflix via Xbox or just having another controller. So I can watch a movie, do email on the Surface, and then use the split window to fast forward/rewind the movie. And then snap the movie to my Surface and walk upstairs with it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Feels great, battery is between a laptop and tablet so far. The strap made my camera very comfortable. I wore it everyday for almost three weeks. The film had a few good laughs, but definitely was about the T&amp;A. It was what was expected in a mid 2000s comedy. Worth the $4.99 - wouldn't have paid more than that. its ink, what can I say... its ink what can I say... its ink It is an awesome little camera filled with posibilities, you can shoot video, stills, time lapse and since it has the waterproof casing you can take it anywhere, just take your time reading carefully the instructions and dowload all available updates on the firmware because there have been a couple. Get a couple of accessories for support and attach. my kids have a blast playing this game, its great exercise too! If you love the original, you'll love this game!! Great graphics and awesome storyline, a must buy! For the price it is a great product. I used it on a family trip to Europe and it preformed extremely well. It could handle multiple shots in it's writing speed. In these 2 movies on seperate Discs, it is Clint Eastwood attempt at comedy. I think he pulled it off. Loved Clyde the Ape. Although the bikers were a little cheesey, who would let their old Knuckle or any Harley for that matter in the street and run like a little kid, or tossed in the dumpster?\n",
        "But they were just movies, and what can you expect from Hollywood.\n",
        "Over all they are pretty good movies. This is an inexpensive handy gadget. It holds plenty of music for a workout. It is compact which means it does not get in the way. excellent product for the price and i highly recommend I think think this movie was great. Made me feel like I was there This is a great product for smart and non-smart Tv's. It has plenty of apps built in and many more to download. Storage is a little low at 4gb. The remote is Bluetooth, I believe, as you don't have to be in line of sight to control it. Loved \"You've Got Mail\" when I first watched it in the 90s. Now that it is on blu-ray, the quality has improved top notch. The bonus movie and features are nice, but it really shows what is missing in today's romantic comedies. Definitely one to buy. I have purchased this ink in the past. It serves it's purpose and prints in good quality. I really like this TV. The styling is nice and the initial set up was simple, including getting it online. I picked up a 3D movie to check out how it worked and was very pleased with the picture. It comes with several pairs of 3D glasses (6 I believe) and they fit over my regular glasses just like the theater ones do. My only complaint is that getting to the set up features could be a bit simpler because you need to reach their app's bar first and, if you were using one of the other app's, scrolling to the settings app then you finally get the pop up menu for the settings. Usual Clint Eastwood, lots of action in both movies, each on a seperate disc. I like that. Blu-Ray edition does take out the fuzzyness that was on the DVD version from years ago. Much better. Love Jillian! She has many different videos &amp; you can choose to work all muscle groups, trouble zones, or target specific areas. 20 minutes to 45 per night 6 days a week. I purchased this one while it was on sale but I found a better deal so I returned this. If you like playstsion products this is one to get! A must buy! I like it enough to keep it but it still does not get all the channels  Very fun and lot of action to explore. You can continue to play this game over and over. This is a good keyboard. But for they money there our others I have used that work just a well for less money. The keys are little on the loud side, but I knew that when I bought it. The keyboard is made very well and sturdy. Unless you really need these type of keys try Microsoft's X4 keyboard when it is on sale for $40 or less. This charger works great and I have had no problems with it at all. great garmin, I have owned 2 now and both have worked really well. This one helped when I was on the freeway and there were multiple lane changes - it was pretty clear which lane I needed to be in to change freeways. I enjoyed the game play but it does get a bit repetitive and has a few bugs. Overall I liked it and would recommend it to a friend. Family watched this and enjoyed it. A little long and boring/slow at times, but overall a good flick. My grandson (and myself) loved this movie. He loves everything lego and loved the Lego Batman movie as well. The ending was somewhat disappointing when you suddenly realized that the movie was all about a little boys imagination. That part lost my grandsons interest, but only for a couple of minutes. Overall, we both thought it was a good movie. Great family movie. We watched it after reading the book and that was excellent. As with all Lifeproof stuff this is another great product to protect the phone. Honestly, I bought this because I wanted the trilogy on Blu-Ray (I already owned First Class) &amp; the sale price was just too good to pass up.\n",
        "\n",
        "The only weak film in this series is Last Stand. The others are excellent - well made, (mostly) well acted, they look great, &amp; there's some excellent social commentary.\n",
        "Also, this came with these collectible character cards that are cool - they've got pictures &amp; a little bio of each character on them Bought for kids who love all things Disney and Infinity....they are having a blast with this! I bought this at the recommendation of the salesman to replace a belkin. This thing is dynamite. Great range throughout the house. Multiple devices at once and cannot tell a decrease in speed. Can stream videos and xbox 360 games live on line. Great great buy! Highly recommended. Overpriced which is par for the course in appliances. For the $69.99 sale price, this headset is unbeatable for Playstation owners. It is very light so it is very comfortable to use for long gaming sessions. I also own the very expensive($399) Parrot Zik bluetooth headphones and these headphones for $69 are close to the Zik's quality. I have read some complaints about the lack of bass, but I assure you that is not the case. I think those complaining are people who are accustomed to listening to overly bass heavy and not properly balanced sound which this headset delivers. There is plenty of punch at the low end on the standard 1 setting along with very crisp and detailed mids and highs. If you are a Playstation gamer and are looking for a headset, do not pass these up, especially at this great price! I needed a 6 foot cable to cover a 5 ft distance. It worked great! I bought this to replace my last Garmin, which I have kept as a backup. The previous one has lines all over the screen that appeared over the 3 years I owned it so I am hoping this one does not have the same issue.\n",
        "\n",
        "I am always happy with a GPS that has Lifetime Maps and Traffic. I liked that I am able to choose what appears on the map screen. This one is not as thick as my previous one which should make it easier to carry around. My only issue so far has been an issue I have with Garmin in general. When you go to set a Point of Interest search, it defaults to where you are locally which is fine. I just wish when you choose the type of POI you are looking for, it would ask you to set the location then, rather than before you choose the type of POI. Either that or when you first select the POI button, ask for the location immediately before choosing a type.\n",
        "\n",
        "While mentioning that issue I have with it, I would still recommend Garmin to anyone looking for a GPS. Plug it in and it works! Good Packaging, easy to open The Lego Movie is one of the rare films that is great for both children &amp; adults. Children will love it - it's funny, entertaining, brightly colored, but so will parents - also funny for them (a fair amount of puns, some parody), there's some social satire ( $36 cup of coffee, anyone?), and it's not brain-numbing like a lot of other \"family friendly\" fair. This was just what we needed. Easily allows Netflix to be viewed on TV. It was very easy to set up and have all family members understand how to use. I am still learning how to use all the features. what i have learned to do so far has been easy. and nice to carry around and check facebook, etc without have to be on a home computer. This projector is ok for the price but it lack connections for up to date electronic devices. If you are looking for something just to clean so spot around your house this is the product for you. It's easy to use and overall good price. Bissell has made great products and this is one of those products. This is a great movie. Looking forward to the third installment in the trilogy. SanDisk is still the best flash drive makers so far..This USB is great: nice design, easy insert, and it supports USB 2.0 and 3.0. I recommend if it is on sale Honestly, not much to say. It's great the console companies have an option to buy from their digital shops without having a credit card. I wasn't quite sure what to expect going into this because how far can you run with a story about Jack the Ripper? Turns out, though the Ripper though a constant threat shadowing the people of White Chapel (at least in this season), it isn't really about him. It's about the men trying to keep order in the very rough streets of White Chapel.\n",

        "As a side note, the language used in the series fascinates me - there's an almost Shakesperean quality to it. Basically good headphones, soft and good sound. Nice feel after long time use. Good product for those who do audiobooks! good portability. Good Compilation on Good Guys or Bad Guys. Brings back good story lines. Product was delivered on time and it was very well packaged. Took only a few minutes to set up and I was on my way. Very happy and I will continue to be an Apple consumer! Solid remote for the PS3, Sony manufactures a great product! joystick sensitivity is good. Plastic handles are not completely smooth allowing for excellent grip. I used this for my uncle's house.\n",

        "Perfect for somebody who wants a all in one solution. Ive had 3 or so of these now, they are the right price. the battery life is impressive. overall they are a good buy. I am a little disappointed with the having to replace it after 9 months to a year. they eventually just don't hold a charge longer than 10 minutes or so. this is typical for any battery. though it seems a little shorter than most. would be nice if it was closer to two years. anyways, still, for the price, its a good buy. way better than AA batteries. HP. Always makes a great product. This product is terrific for the price. Ok, these are older movies from Tom Cruise. But when I don't see them for a while, months, they are like watching for the first time (almost).\n",

        "If you haven't seen these before, they are full of action, car and motorcycle chases. Over all I am very satisfied. Works a great canister vacuum. I use it every week for cleaning hard wood floors and some carpet areas. I has good suction to pick really tiny pieces of dirt but I does not have the power to pick big pieces like paper bits etc.\n",

        "Little fragile but works great. Overall very satisfied. got this TV for my sons room, for the price, its a pretty decent TV. I didn't want to get anything pricey, didn't need to be big and fancy with super high resolution. just watches mickey mouse on DVD. I did put an action movie in to see how it looks and I was satisfied with the picture quality. (this was on DVD not Blu-ray). again, for the price, you cant go wrong. Ive had it for a month or two now, so far so good. I'd buy another if I had another room in need of a similar TV. HP. Always makes a great product. The color is terrific. Season one was great, season two even better, i cant wait to see season three. It as a good action movie and tied in good to the last movie. It is a good 3-D movie to watch. Whether film' fiction or fact, it was totally entertaining! Cinematography, Acting and Action were on POINT! Bravo! nice compilation of a career body of work, a lot of good music Bought as a gift for my son. We all enjoyed the movie Great begining of a great series, better than most block buster movies! They told the whole story very well, you got into all of the characters in a very believable way. Had my doubts about Ben Affleck as a superhero, but he pulled it off great. Can't wait to see him as Batman! Much better than the Gal Tab 2. Needed to upgrade due to screen and better processor. I am very happy so far with my purchase other than somebody has not yet figured out the flash. Used to be able to watch flash on facebook with the tab2. I am sure it will be figured out soon.. Great protection for your device. This was for my son's new iPod touch. Good price and peace of mind knowing we won't have to replace the iPod whenever it drops! Dynamic phone display. Call audio could be better. Buttons are too hard to press. Battery life is not worth nothing. However, this phone has bell and whistles like finger print reader, heart beat monitor and pedometer. very good musicianship, very versatile with multiple vocalists, look forward to their next endeavor Great Movies, all time classics. I can watch them over and over again and never get tired if seeing them. This is a great modem. I got it to replace my 8 year old SurfBoard. This thing is monumentally faster! Love it! It's a memory card, do you really need to know more? Got the expansion pack for my dad. Good additions to continued game play. It is great the way they have tied Alien and Predator together, brought back my interest in both movies. The creature effects were awesome, you get to see both Alien and Predator like never before. Good graphic updates to the SimCity line. Glad they have it so you do not need internet connection to do single player mode now. Love the audio for incoming calls.\n",
        "Don't like it doesn't have a audible message waiting. I was very pleased with this movie. I'm a huge Evil Dead fan, and this reminded me a lot of the second and third intallments. I definitely would recommend this. This film is by far most my favorite mob movie and truly the best mob movie ever. I'm very happy with this Panasonic Microwave. I never had a Panasonic Microwave before It is super quiet and cooks very well. The smart Sensor is the best for re-heating food. I'm extremely impressed with this tablet. The screen is simply astounding. Colours are vibrant, with excellent brightness and contrast. Reading, browsing and watching videos is a pleasure. I haven't had it long enough to properly assess battery life so far. It's a Samsung, so there's Touchwiz to deal with, but it doesn't bother me too much, aside from a little lag (which really should not happen on devices this powerful, Samsung). It's Android though, so you can always replace the launcher if desired. Otherwise, it's very fast, comfortable to hold. My only concern is the lack of storage space. 16GB is not to much these days, I really think 32GB should be the minimum. Having said that, it does have a MicroSD card slot, so I'm hoping I'll be able to install media, and possibly large games, on there - but I have not yet tried. All in all, it's really a great product, and a pleasure to hold and use. I have tried many, many tablets through the past few years. As long as I can get my games an media on it, this guy might be a keeper. This is the data wire cable for the 5'C phone of my son and is really good, practical to use, easy to take out. I've had the phone a couple months now and it works good! I like the speaker phone feature on the handset and I love being able to use the handset to listen to messages. Only thing I dislike about this phone is the forward feature is a little awkward. Bought an HP printer first and had problems with the scanner and the network connections... Took that back and bought this!! This was as stated a plug and play unit. Everything worked and software was easy to use. Fun and futuristic additions for the original game. Good price, and works on different devices, we really are satisfied. This is the data wire cable for the 5's phone of my daughter and is really good, practical to use, easy to take out. Very good for older eyes. Screen is crisp and easy to see details. I went expecting to buy a rocket fish charger, but after finding issues with two previous ones, I decided to go for the apple one. I knew I wanted a longer cable, and although it was expensive I was able to apply my return amount towards this product. I defiantly recommend it to anyone needing a long lasting charging cable. The mini iPad is much more portable than the full size version. The i-Tunes software should allow for more customization of choices. Lots of apps available and I like how Apple screens them. FaceTime and iMessage only works and on Apple products but there are other apps that allow you to video message your friends on any other platform. This is a great product for having fun and if you have kids. If you are looking for a tablet that is also for work or home productivity, I recommend a Windows or Android based tablet. DC Animation does it again with yet another installment of the Batman comic / graphic novel film. This printer is everything I was looking for in a printer for the price. No problems or complaints. i love how it has been updating with the world cup content! Easy set up - works great - I live in a loft with 24' ceilings &amp; it sends a strong signal throughout my space with good security. I have been extremely satisfied with this phone. The duarability is great. I also like the music options with the phone. I travel quite a bit a enjoy the clarity of the sound. madden is the classic football game for any system. cant go wrong This game is awesome! I have beaten the story mode and still continue to play it trying to achieve 100% completion. the online modes will keep you busy for ever too. I'm hoping they release some DLC in the future. works great. i tend to shy away from the aftermarket controllers Great sequal to a great remake, i hope they plan on making more of these movies about the Titans I use this memory with my Samsung Galaxy S5. It records UHD video files with no problems. We got this camera for the kids to play with. We've been blown away by the quality of the videos they've shot. It is a lot of fun to play with when in the pool or sports. Won't replace your regular camera but it is still worth the expense. easy to install unit - working great thus far - nice price docking station works excellent and keeps battery life up I ws looking for in-the-ear Bluetooth headphones that were not extremely expensive, but with great quality. These are those headphones. the docking station works very well to charge the controllers and stop the charge to keep their battery life up My 9 yr. old son AJ loves this game and plays it everyday. at times cant get him to put it down,he loves everything about it. I enjoy using both my desktop and laptop (w/docking station) units using just 1 keyboard and mouse. That's where this KVM switch comes in. It was easy to setup and use. I replaced my older Belkin 2 port KVM switch because it wouldn't seem to retain my new monitor's resolution settings. This new IO gear 2 port KVM switch does retain my monitor's resolution setting. I like the USB ports for keyboard/mouse inputs/outputs unlike my older Belkin KVM switch that used the older style PS2 connections. Additionally, You can't beat the price. Everything you wanted about Austin Powers in one package, i'm glad i found this!!! this is a good case for people working in tough condidtions or have a crazy family. this case has a pretty big price tag but it is worth it. the only bad thing about this case(thats why i gave it four stars)is the screen protector. when u press down on the screen to tap something the screen protector doesnt lay flat on the screen, it has a small gap so when u press on the screen it makes a wierd sound and is really annoying. but over all pretty good case very easy to set up and begin using immediately!!!!! This album is a very good CD. trhe songs are well done and the album is heavy. This tv is excellent for the price. It sets up really fast on the mount. Then just follow on screen images to set up tv for internet and cable it was super easy! I tried buying a sharp tv before this one and will never make that mistake again. I will always be a samsung tv owner from here on out! Iphone convert! Love this phone. The camera is amazing! Wow, this is an awesome set, there are so many wonderful specials in the set that it's a must have for any true Batman fan. The packaging is amazing, the prints are awesome, the bonus footage and discs (especially the Trilogy Bonus Disc) are outstanding... warning though, if you don't want to spoil the movie magic, you might want to skip those parts. Suspension of disbelief, is easier not knowing how the special effects are done, but knowing how they are created, gives you a whole new respect and insight into the movies. I just can't say enough good things about all the extras that you get! The only thing that disappointed me a little bit, was the vehicle reproductions. They weren't made for this special boxed set. One is marked Hot Wheels even. That said, it's the high end Hot Wheels, not the 97 cents ones you picked up as a kid. Hearing the thoughts, goals and desires of the creators, directors, writers, actors, etc. is simply amazing. Seeing behind the curtain, to understand more deeply each scene, costume, actor choice, etc. enriches the entire movie(s) experience. Buy it for yourself or as a gift, you can't go wrong! Great box set, putting it together in one package is awesome! What's to say. It's a wire the lets my play Pandora from my droid through my receiver. It works. works as advertised, no problems with using or charging Purchased on sale, makes connecting to helmot or bike easy. I will purchase another unit for extra parts. Has many useful featured for us. Mainly purchased to use Netflick streaming. I tried buying an adapter since I already had one of these for my ipad but the old style. That didn't work so I went back and got this one. It works as good as the other does. no problems. I have installed and used a few of these. This is the only one to start lifting.  makes the xbox one easier then ever. logs you in instantly. responds well to voice commands. Besides getting an outstanding deal, this Fridge looks and performs great.\n",
        "We just bought a new house and to match the appliances already there we went with the white.\n",
        "This thing looks like a space ship inside with all the cool LED lights and compartments. Now i have a new reason to drink more water and go to the supermarket more often.\n",
        "And the sound, the sound by itself it's exiting. It's like Mozart composed a symphony for when you want water, ice cubes or crushed ice.\n",
        "Overall a great item for the price. I consider this a toy, not the best use for office work. Great for surfing and emailing. My first TV purchase in many years. The picture is of excellent quality in bright or dim light- the sound is amazing (even on low) with the exception being when actors are murmuring or speaking low on screen. Picture can easily be seen not only from those seated in front across the room, but to the side as well. There is no glare or fuzziness. This controller is great. It is very comfortable in your hands, and the battery life is outstanding. There is never any lag between clicking and response on the TV screen, so it is pretty much everything you could want for a controller. This game is very recommendable to kids cause its fun and cool Sons of Anarchy is one of the best series ever put on tv. Mario Kart 8 is probably my favorite Mario Kart game of all time. The graphics are really amazing in full HD, and the online play always makes game play challenging. I bought this because i like the teenage mutant ninja turtles. I love my new dryer. It's the right size and very easy to maintain with its updated technology. My daughter and my mother has a similar set, so I just purchased one about a month ago. I had a standard washer and dryer set before. Uses very little time to completely dry any load of clothes....no re-drying or re-setting so far. Great game. Kind of reminds me of Grand Theft Auto, but the main character can be a criminal or vigilante. I bought this alarm clock because I liked it very much. It is compact so my night stand has more space for me to use. This is a great basic receiver, I use it to power my outdoor speakers. I like that you carry the originals, I have bought \"no names\" online from companies and short time later had to replace. I bought this for my son to record games on COD. It was fairly easy for him to set up but it was not easy to get the sound right with his Astro headset. He got a lot of feedback at first but I think he has it worked out. I guess the software was pretty easy to use since he didn't ask me for help :) All in all, pretty cool gadget. Bought this unit to replace an older Bose unit along with new TV, DVD, and cable box. Liked to overall simplicity of the sound bar with wireless bass unit and integrated switching of video sources. Great sound that easily fills the room. Bose audio calibrate utility is easy to use and well worth the 10 minutes of effort to setup for the room. Setup of the remote as a single remote was a bit tricky as the \"learn\" utility could not find the new Samsung components. Manual setup (selection by code) was much easier. A caution that the video inputs can be HDMI, composite, or component but a separated DVI + separate audio is not supported. User instructions (as well as on line) are minimal for the user looking for more technical details and do not explain setup of external IR devices although the transmitters are provided. Good print cartridge that lasts a while and for an old printer like mine still produces well. My previous case was a pain to clip on the belt, and did not have a long life as the clip didn't stay affixed to the case firmly for very long. This one is easy to clip on and access, and looks like it's structure will last much longer. We'll see! Nice little device. Gets the job done. I recomend. I loved this item. I do a side job as a CD printer for local bands. The quality of this printer is professional grade! I love it. I have loved this radio for the purpose I purchased it. I take it to the pool and on the boat at the lake .... it works great. I also listen to my I Pod on this radio and the sound is perfect for what I wanted. My teenage grand kids were very pleased. I bought this product to watch mainly \"you tube\" on TV screen! Instructions are very easy to set up. The only thing is sometimes it freezes (I do not know because of my computer or not). Otherwise, I like it! I love my new high efficiency washer. It's the right size and very easy to maintain with its updated technology. My daughter and my mother has a similar set, so I just purchased one about a month ago. I had a standard washer and dryer set before. The overall game is fun to play. The environment is immersive and gameplay stays fresh with different weapon combinations. This is a good product for less. Very good feel and great handling. This is a great radio, bluetooth sound! I use mine in my kitchen as a radio while entertaining or simply feeling in the mood for some music. I love the extended battery life, so if I choose to unplug and move it I don't have to reprogram it. This device plays music with a clear and crisp sound. I'm very impressed with the product. I had stopped using apple for a few years, but sold my S4 tablet and purchased the ipad air. I am always happy with my apple although it took a little getting used to after my andriod.\n",
        "My biggest problem is that I cannot multi-task as well as I used to with my android...so that's a big setback for me. I love the facetime/video quality. I dont use it top take pics or videos so I am not yet sure how it will meet up to my expectations there....but watching movies \"WOW\"!!!! Great product just wish I could use it with my Circa Notebook from Levenger. Another great product for notes. This product does what it promises but I do feel like I spend a lot of time cleaning. About 5-10 minutes each time I use. I use to often to use the dishwasher each time I can take this little thing everywhere with me. As long and I have a iPhone and Internet I can watch movies. Camera bag is great. Caught a good sale and my camera fits perfectly. I love the additional pockets for extra batteries and SD cards. Bag is very comfortable. I like the Braun shaver and it is very dependable. This cartridge keeps the shaver clean with no fuss. The only problem is the length of time that it lasts. Even if you haven't seen The Lord of the rings trilogy, you can still follow along with this one. Very entertaining! I have owned all the different versions, and this one is by far the greatest. The games are so clear and fun. Love this case! Closes on it's own, which was one of my concerns. Slim design, so no extra bulk. Product works as intended. I have used several of the discs already and the quality of production seems perfect. Very engaging movie, great acting. Storyline very good. Good moving story and with good ending. I got this to replace my original cable. It works great, I like the lights so that I know it is charging. It is just not very flexible. I would purchase again, if needed. I purchased this little speaker a few weeks ago and it has been great wireless speaker system. The sound is great for such a small system. Only one downfall I have found so far is that although you can sync multiple devices via bluetooth, if you want to actually switch devices to stream from, you have to go to the speaker and hit the bluetooth button Used this mainly when swimming with the kid, but found that the handle showed most of the time. Not such a big deal, but I think where the pivot joints are cause this. Bought this to prop the kinect on top of my Plasma TV. It's easy to use. The Kinect screws into the mount just like a camera onto a tripod. The mount can be extended to compensate for deeper TVs, and the arm that secures the mount to the TV clicks into place for whatever width opening you need it to be.\n",
        "\n",
        "The camera sensor cover is good for keeping the dust off the camera when not in use, or keeping big brother out of your house for those overly paranoid folks. It slides right on with little to no friction. this is a good cd i dont listen to this artist but my girlfriend does but listening to this makes me like it more tho there are some songs i do not like cause thy are slow and not my kind of pace but listening to this with her is actually relaxing Set up instructions are clear and easy to follow. Spring loaded clips make repositioning the TV super easy. Excellent action and fantasy movie. Very entertaining with excellent cinematography. Whole family will enjoy this! Excellent, very funny and entertaining for whole family. This is classic comedy at it's best. Make sure everyone in your family watches! I am happy with the purchase. Great job on the floors. I purchase two of these and my friend loves it. As for me I did not like the feel of having something hanging on to me neck all day.....since I use it for atleast 10 hours a day.\n",
        "It was very clear even in a noisy enviroment the party on the other end heard me without any distortion Product works great, I was able to take a Two of these with multiple Y connectors and now my kids can switch between gaming devices, DVD player, Direct TV to multiple TVs without my help. This is a bad*** movie. Everything was awesome about it. A lot of action I had not watched sitcoms for many years until someone recommended The Big Bang Theory. I really enjoy it, and I look forward to each episode. Needed a new inexpensive cable for my tablet and this worked perfectly! I use this because I have a hearing problem. So, instead of blaring the speakers on the TV loud, I can put this on and hear everything pretty well. It's great for wearing at night too, when you don't want to wake the kids or the Mrs. Works with all types of headphones. Volume up and down buttons on the module is a nice touch. It doesn't really add much weight to the controller, and fits in nicely. Clear picture and sound, playback is very clear, I just love it. I was surprised at the clarity of the pictures. Since I have an I pad already I knew how to use it would buy it again Needed earphones that my 7 yr old daughter would actually use. These worked perfectly and very stylish. I have used these shields before with other devises and they work great but this one has some sort of particulate on the screen that is causing a persistent bubble. The updated version of the clash of the titans is much better than the original I broke my Note 3 phone screen, and it went completely black, but the pen still worked (BONUS BIG FOR BIG 'OL SMART PHABLET). I tried using the screen mirroring which worked but was slow to respond, there is about a half second delay between the press and the result action. Since i was trying to recover pictures, game data, work docs, etc this was painful. I found this option the Samsung - Micro USB-to-HDMI Adapter and it was great. Once you get use to looking at a monitor or tv, while touching your phone this thing is awesome, I recovered all my data in about 20 minutes, verse several hours wasted trying the screen mirroring. The only reason I complained about the external supply is that the Note 3 comes with a usb 3 charging / data cord, so I had to find my old usb 2 cord from a previous device. But overall this thing works great on the Note 3 if you crack your screen and need to recover data because it goes dark. This is also a cool toy to carry with at work if you need to share stuff you have on your phone with others and dont have a smart tv available for screen mirroring. Replacement of crashed Samsung hard drive in HP Pavilion PC . No BIOS conflicts. Recovery went fine. This HDMI cable works well. It is compatible with all our home connection needs. Great remote to use with Blu Rays. Very easy and comfortable in hands. Lights up. Great remote. I need cartridges for my HP printer and it is sometimes hard to find this particular cartridge. I would prefer to have the large cartridge but this particular one is adequate for my use. Product works great, I was able to take a handful of these with the AV switch and now my kids can switch between gaming devices, DVD player, Direct TV without my help. This dishwasher installation kit was perfect for our Bosch dishwasher. Easy to install and easy to use. Glad we bought it. Good movie, enjoyed it, had a lot of action and story line was ok. this is a good quality product, very easy and fast to install. Apple TV works very well. Only issues we have are with buffering on our home WiFi as it rquires that all other devices be turned off in order to work properly. It is easy to put on and take off and is the lightest of full covers Our Bosch dishwasher has some of the best reviews from Consumer Reports, and it lives up to its name. Easy to use, economical to run. The best dishwasher buy for the money. It was so much better to buy this modem than lease on from Time Warner---pays for itself in a year This is an excellent second TV for the\"play room\". It is extremely easy to connect external devices via WiFi and apps. Picture is good but sound quality is average. It seems like the input \"switches\" without prompting from AV to component. It has only happened a few times and easily switched back. Excellent movie if you are a fan of 300 story. Very good sequel with good following from the first movie. It is a little slow at the begining but pick up real quick after the first 15 minutes. The action and battle sequences are awesome! Excellent selection on DVD's\n",
        "used and new are great Great TV size for the price. Good quality picture, sound not too great. Happy with the purchase. Duracell last better than any other brand and are worth paying a little more The size makes great for taking in your laptop case. Does not take much room. This was an enexpsensive gift I gave my wife on the fly. This replaced her Vera Bradley an Bama tumblers which were pretty darn pricey. She loves Hello Kitty but she wouldn't use this thing if it didn't keep her drinks cold for a good long of time. Had originally bought a Toshiba smart tv that did not come with a browser. I returned it and bought this one and I could not be happier. Fast and easy to use. Comes with micro adapter. Great price. When this item arrived I was disappointed, when I opened and put it together I thought man am I glad I kept it. Bought this for me Hello Kitty fanatic wife. She loves it. I used it a couple times to charge my phone and it seems to charge pretty quickly. The cord fits my TV perfectly. I would like to possibly have a longer one. Really love the Kinnect, works great, can't remember the last time I've used my remote, I love the voice commands! I love being able to watch TV outside on the patio. This has helped accomplish this for me. Holds 36 K Cups in a slide out drawer. We put the Keurig on top of the holder to save counterspace. Good product. This makes a great gift for the Xbox gamer. Simple to use. Enter the code to redeem the value and pick up a game or two. I would definitely buy another one. I love Samsung products! Overall this is a great product. I highly recommend this modem for easy, fast internet searches, streaming, and gaming! This is great fridge overall. An area I would like to see an improvement in is the temperature ranges for the fridge and freezer area. Works with the surface 3, really you have to buy it. So yes works when typed on, like the color choices. Great phone - it is easy to use and the camera is good. Not my favorite horror movie. But not a bad movie, and is worth watching. Recommend renting the movie. Not a collector movie. I was needing a 8G flash drive and most have been a little more pricey than what I wanted to pay. When I saw this on Best Value I knew I had to order it. It works just as well as the high priced ones and so far I have been really happy with it. I had it shipped because it also came with free shipping and you cannot beat that. Item was shipped and I received it in a couple of days. It was so easy to order online. The sound that this speaker system puts out is incredible Great product for charging iPhones plus it is trendy. My teenagers like the design; it lights up when charging. It was easy to plug in and use. The graphics clarity is wonderful. I did not know there would be so much improvement between LED and LCD. The improved technology is a blessing for partially sighted people. If you like to be entertained then this is a good movie. Has some laugh out loud moments and is worth the watch. She loves the color and the fit. She wears them daily. Very attractive as well as functional. Fits easily in pockets or purse This audio cable is solid. Great performance and very durable. I use it for various equipment and it delivers every time.  This was super easy to install (I'm not very tech savvy and even I figured it out!) and had all of the programs I needed to complete various school projects. My son loved this movie! I'm sure we will be watching it time and time again Fits like a glove. A perfect quick protection made with high quality materials and construction. Just when I thought I knew what was going to happen next something changes the story. Very exciting. I really love my HP laptop!\n",
        "It serves all I need to do very well.\n",
        "It is light and easy to transport when staying with family.\n",
        "The price was excellent! Bought in a 'bundle'. It's really good movie. It is kinda different than first one Great for stocking stuff is an easy to use love it Saw this in theater and had a much more enjoyable time than I first thought I would with a movie like this. It's got humor, action, and a well written story. I haven't gotten into the extras just yet, but this movie still is amazing! Looks good on Blu-Ray as well! My daughter loves this movie and it was great for adults too I have seen this several times and never got around to buying it, that is until I recently saw the sequel \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" and decided that I really do enjoy this one as well, so I bought it. Just like that. It's a great setup to the franchise and Caesar is an amazing ape performed adequately by Andy Serkis. He should be considered for an oscar because he clearly IS Caesar and brings quite a presence to the role/ape. The ear pods are specially designed and streamlined to capture sound with its newly shaped ear piece.\n",
        "With its built in controls within reach, adjusting the volume is a breeze, even works well with incoming calls when used with your mobile phone. With everybody on the go these are great for stocking stuffers for everyone's headphones I purchase this for a friend and he loves it. It is perfect for his needs. Grandson plays this game all the time and they love it even my granddaughters like to play the main problems is Win. 8 which is not for no nonses pro. However, I like using this computer. Probablly you should add the possibility to buy it with another OS for pro's. I AM SO IMPRESSED OF THE PERFORMANCE, AND THE LOOKS OF THIS COMPUTER. BY JUST LOOKING AT IT, YOU KNOW ALREADY THAT THIS COMPUTER WAS MADE TO LAST. THE QUALITY OF THE MATERIAL USED, IS SO SOLID , SO RELIABLE! AND IT CAN WITHSTAND ANYTHING, FROM GAMING, MUSIC, MOVIES, OR JUST SIIMPLY DOING SOME PROJECTS, AND SOME RESEARCH. IT WON'T LET YOU DOWN!. The screens were easy to put on the phone plus the colors are great. I Just bought this for my wife.\n",
        "She loves its color as it is wine red. My 3 year old baby follows it around while it is cleaning which is quite funny to watch.\n",
        "I was skeptical at first because of the cost but it exceeded my expectations. The pattern cleaning cleans up the room well. Crazy to see the dust bin and how full it is after a cleaning session. My wife is happy with it and celebrates every day that she no longer has to vacuum and mop. I am pleased with my purchase and one less chore around the house. It great it's gold it's not dying on me cause it has monster battery life and is very quick and responsive easy to carry and different colors. Soft case..... If you keep a tidy home already then this is perfect for you. I have three small dogs and this machine keeps the hair in check. So convenient for me lightweight easy to use and ready for me when I'm on the go. I'm a huge Joss Whedon fan and remember watching this show when it was first on, I don't remember that much from this show, but know that I do enjoy this show. That's why I decided to buy this item to finally be able to re-watch them all. Plus the extra unaired episodes are nice. Again, too bad this has only the one season; they dropped the ball on a fantastic show I bought this adapter so my son could connect to wifi with his desktop computer. No complaints about connectivity even with online video games. Bought this for steam summer sale and it was used for exactly what I bought it for perfectly easy to carry and different colors. Soft case...... My kids love and enjoy this movie. When we go on outings and long trips, this movie goes withbus. Remember\"Everything is Awesome\"... Satisfied with my products. I definitely would recommend it anybody. This product is being used by my daughter in her Surface which will be great with school work. She already has movies and enough space for documents for school work.. The Lins is great for distance from a long long range. The picture appear to be right in front of you. Heavy PC user and love this monitor. Great looking display thanks to the HDMI hookup! Would definitely purchase this monitor again. Great earbuds. They sound good and work fine I just wish they were ten dollars cheaper This is the best shoulder carry on ever. so why do I need to write fifty words or better when the case is so great and holds everything that you want leave home without it. The picture quality is great, and it's a great starter camera, I hope to grow with it, getting more lenses and attachments. I adore the pictures I've gotten from it, and the video quality is nothing to sniff at either! I thought that I would not like it because it goes behind the ear. However, I really like the idea that it is inconspicuously hidden. Has a great keeper case that fits in my front pocket comfortably. Like it. Good sound quality very easy to set up thinking of buying one for my parents This is my first ipad, etc, and first time using this cover.. I also bought another one for traveling to protect it. Much better charger than the previous I owned and used for Kindle. This charger has better reinforcement at the plug, since mostly used by kids. I love Otter Box and this is the best they've made so far. The outer rubber shell stays on and doesn't get loose. I've dropped my phone dozens of times and it keeps my phone safe! Nice remote with glow numbers so it is easy to use with the lights out. The numbers are larger which makes it easy to read as well. Windows 8 is a piece of garbage as it make one have to re learn to a great extent this helps with that process Great classic............ Love it all................ Awesome price, awesome product. The whole family loves watching this TV. Excellent picture quality. :) Upgraded from the Galaxy Victory, and I do think it was an upgrade, especially for the price I paid. Phone has every feature I could imagine wanting, and everything works pretty smoothly and as expected. I didn't think the bloatware was too bad - nothing too intrusive or annoying with the LG-provided apps and software. Resolution could be better and processor could be faster, but that's why the phone is the price that it is. Battery life is pretty good. At first I was going an easy 4 days on a charge with moderate use (unheard of!) but after a few weeks of charges now I'm down to about 2 and a half, so still quite solid. I think I'd take the resolution-for-battery-life tradeoff any day in my personal opinion, anyway. Awesome...........................awesome............. Every tv in my home has one on it. I am an apple user at heart, but would purchase this over Apple TV any day. It's easy enough for my 80 year old grandparents to use! Shocked to find this item at such an affordable price I went from desk top to laptop to IPad so am still learning how to use all the features on it. This is hands down the handiest printer ever. Can print on the go. And cam give out the printers email address so others can 'mail' documents and they just print out. I'm amazed. Scanning from the adf directly to the smart phone. I rarely ever use the pc for anything. Seriously amazing tool. was on sale picked it up it was a good piece of software. There soft and great sounds. Great distance signal I was really wanting something of a brand not too bold...then found this hazelnut, it smells so wonderful and so tasty...didn't make a mistake buying this... my husband is very, very satisfied with all his items he bought. He has told everybody he know about this camera, which is getting on my nerves(smile) We both think the camera is a great investment for home and business. we are looking forward to traveling soon with the camera, which He can't wait. The camera is a lot of fun posing with each other. we have lots of laughs. put this memory in an upgrade it worked fine and the performance of the computer went from 1.5 to 3 this memory I believe was the major reason for the increased performance. EVERYTHING IS OK WITH THIS PRODUCT, WORKS VERY WELL WITH MY PRINTER, VERY EASY TO INSTALL My ipad air has proven to be everything as it was described! It's light weight and highly portable. The resolution and speed are dazzling. It's been very easy to upload new apps as well as to navigate. I am very pleased with my purchase! The USB 3 is so must faster the USB 2. I will always use USB 3 Granted, I've never watched The Wire or The Shield, but compared to the more typical, popular cop dramas out there this is just so beyond what you see - such deep, complicated characters that you actually may care more about them than the case they're trying to solve. But the way the plot itself unravels and is told (jumping between past and present) is truly fantastic and engaging. I don't see how anybody can watch any of those Law and Orders or Blue Bloods or whatever while knowing stuff like True Detective is out there. Matthew McConaughey is so fantastic. A little expensive for what it is. But it's comfortable and handy. Wish or had some sort of cooling feature as it offers very little ventilation. Still room for a mouse with a 15.6 notebook. Product easy to use and fits well in ipad. Easy way to upload photos. Makes using my plex media manager a snap. Stores upright and out of the way. Been on the supplied batteries for months. I got the white as it seemed easier for hunter peck typists to use the keyboard in a dim room. Easy instalation best single din cd receiver that i have purchesed Lots of memory that is enough for over 1700 pictures. I've had it before and i got no problems with it. It's an excellent product plus i had a good price for it. Got the cheap rca worth rabbit ears and returned it for this set. This is much more elegant. The panel is easy to hide. The controversy is that the amplifier makes the most difference. If you are close to a digital tower the amp may be a hinderence. This is a great camera for the price. It easily fits in the pocket and handy for traveling. Overall, very good value and would choose again. Went with Insignia for price and we are pleased with performance too. This card was super easy to install hardware and software wise. It is very stable and I have had no issues with it with daily use since purchase. I'll stay by admitting I don't usually go out and spend hundreds on the newest smartphone- if you're that type of person, def get a G3. But having worked in wireless for 6+ yrs I've used almost every device put out by Samsung, htc &amp; even Apple in that time... And the G2 by far blows them all away! The \"knock-on\" feature to unlock the screen by double tapping is so practical &amp; useful it seems necessary to me now. If I use someone else's phone it feels like I'm taking a step backwards having to use the lock button... Lol. Aside from that, the processor is just as fast as the Galaxy S4 &amp; S5, as well as the htc One; and makes anything Apple has ever put out look like a joke, quite frankly. Love the Q-Slide apps- I can use the dialer, calculator, calendar, read &amp; send texts, and more as on screen widgets without actually opening the app... No other smartphone line does that! The battery life is fantastic- gets through a full 16-18 hr day no prob (usually still between 20-30% when I finally plug in for the night). The buttons on the back setup does take a little getting used to, but after a couple days really just makes more sense ;plus with the knock on feature and volume slider in the drop down menu, the buttons are all but unnecessary anyway. This is by far the greatest in a long line of smartphones I've used in the past several yrs... Oh, and I paid $1 for the 32gb model, seriously. Very satisfied! Just what I needed. Upgraded my old I Phone and just in time. I have another case that is very unhandy to use; this one is great to put camera and extra lens in and is very comfortable to carry. Love it! This was the best idea ever! My daughter lost her iphone in the ocean, she wasn't due for an upgrade yet, so this phone filled in well until she was able to get the upgrade. Great sound. So so mic. Works great with win 8.1 even though not packaged as compatible. Bought it for dictating. Didn't work out near as well as I had hoped. That's ok. Really like the inline controls. I love my MacBook Air 13' is so light, and the battery life is amazing! I used a MacBook Pro before this one and I find the Air so much easy to charge and use... Thanks! The sound quality is simply amazing and I get a great workout at the gym while listen to my music with my Dr. Dre Wireless Headphones!! I bought a ipad 16 gig I truely love it.i was debating on buying the bigger one.but happy I bought the smaller one.it fits perfect in my purse.its a great product I bought one for each of my daughters. Card works well with my Nikon D7100 and also my Panasonic camcorder. Good movie for kids and adults very cute I love this movie I love the dragons can not wait for next season. Great show. Blazingly fast. Using it to record uh dv no problems. I honestly thought this would be much slower than my ssd but it has far exceeded my needs. Been a wd customer for more years than I care to admit. Perfect bag size for my Sony NEX camera. Also has a pocket for extra memory cards or a small charger. COD Ghosts has wonderful game plays and lots of action. It is best when played with lots of friends. Using the toxic gas is the best. Demolition. Boom. CW best show. Excellently written and executed. Takes one of DCs least interesting heroes and gives him a well deserved overhaul. This TV is incredible!\n",
        "I bought it to watch the 2014 FIFA World Cup matches and wasn't sure about it at first. I was also considering purchasing the model with 3d and 240Hz, but after careful consideration I kept this one.\n",

        "The image is amazing! But the best feature, by far, are the Smart TV apps!\n",

        "So, if you don't need an even bigger tv and don't need 3D, get this one and save some money!\n",
        "I don't think the 120Hz / 240 Hz would make any difference on 99% of what you watch! Now my sons favorite movie. Great for the kids and those young at heart. This game is an exceptional example of family friendly good times.\n",
        "\n",
        "I would caution, like most Mario games, this doesn't require much . . . intellectual effort to master and it's replay value is limited to your kids willingness to drag you back to playing it.\n",

        "I play with my 6 year old every few days and we are both entertained. $60 bucks is pretty hard to swallow for these types of games but there is a pretty limited Decalogue of games you can play with a 6 year old that don't make you contemplate punting your Wii U . . . so there's that. Mario golf is a great game. I really enjoyed playing it. It has real golf gameplay and also has golf stages with a twist of mario separately just in case you only like the original golf rules like I do which I think was a good decision! Very satisfied! Great product for the price. Fully charges my phone or tablet when I need it. Great for emergencies. It's a great sequel to a very funny movie. Again the acting and line exchange between actors makes you laugh. A must see to laugh your butt off Not as good as the nuud case. Cover over screen is clumsy sometimes. I purchased this computer with the student discount and I got a great deal! I am a huge Apple fan so it works well and syncs with my other Apple products. We are delighted with the TV, which replaced a large clunker of a TV in an upstairs sitting room. The picture is clear and beautiful and everything I hoped for. Bought this primarily\n",
        "For travel! Looks great! Easy to use! Storage amount perfect!! I have all The Lord of the ring movies and the hobbit 1 and 2. This movie is very long but if you're a true lord of the rings fan it's worth the buy. However if your not you'll probably end up falling asleep or won't understand half of it. I recommend for L.O.T.R fans only Had this for a long time. Has a lot of storage and is good quality. It's a great story line. Retired CIA members who the CIA tries to kill but can't. The funny lines that come out between the actors is a classic. A good movie to laugh hour butt off We used this to charge our phones and iPods in Edinburgh, London, and Orlando. It packed small and light, worked flawlessly, and kept us all charged up two devices at a time. I love the longer cable to charge my phone with cause i can charge and still use my phone if necessary :) This movie is just awesome! If you like mobster/ action flics then this is the movie for you. The action never ceases and the retro feel of Los Angeles is cool! A really good movie to add to any collection. Blu-Ray option is a huge plus! Fair pricing; I am thrilled with this find!  Not that great on bass but decent. Great sound. Battery life should be longer in my opinion. The warriors is an awesome movie! A true classic! Totally worth the price This TV is great for any bedroom. Perfect size and very clear picture. I have mine in my office and it works perfect :) I think it's good hard and 500 GB not bad for storage Great action packed movie. The action never stops and the acting is superb. The plot takes you from the early years to adulthood and explains why the hunters act the way they do and what motivates them. The witches all have various hideous looks and the graphics are great. This music is something I could listen to and ride to all day. The texture and form of this mouse is outstanding, the only cons I have are the synapse program it's the only way to use the multi buttons and I would like multi buttons to have a little more click feel to them its the best phone I had ,,,great quality in pictures and more. I like her music, she is a good rapper. My son who is two dances to her songs. I like the phone and I recommend this S5 too youuu This is a different spin on a classic show and I really enjoyed it all Taken is action packed keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire film. they could not have picked a better lead actor to play this role very well cast if you like action you will like this movie. We love the Apple TV and give it 5 stars!!!! We have an Apple TV in every bedroom and the living room! Can stream from my itunes account, use our netflix account, hulu plus, HBO2go and much much more! It is worth every penny!! HP's ENVY x360 2-in-1 convertible has excellent features and impressive audio. I've owned this laptop/tablet for only a few days and I am completely satisfied with my purchase, for now at least. It's quick, does what it says it is supposed to do and makes my life easier with its 2-in-1 design. As of now, I am able to get about 4 hours on a charge when using HP's recommended power level. As for HP's power save option, I am able to get about 5 hours on a charge. Battery life is average, but the display has issues of its own. Though this laptop has a full HD display, it seems as if the display is cheaply manufactured and most certainly has horrible viewing angles; tablet mode is basically a useless feature because of the display. Overall, I believe this convertible is perfect for any individual with a creative mindset. Fun game system very fun to play has great new features. I have enjoyed watching all the xmen movies. I also spent alot of time watching behind the scenes and deleted scenes. Watching the movies on blue ray are so crisp and clear, its way better than the DVDs. This is a great series! Get the entire series. you will enjoy it This is a good value for a large supply of batteries. Good graphics. Great story line and easy to love each character. Some more than others. This is an awesome game ! I like how it looks, the reality and effects of it. Overall it works great. battery charging seems to take awhile. It has replaceable memory mini SD card, so you have an option to buy more mini Sd cards for addtion storage. It would be better if it was USB 3.0. This has to have been the greatest movie that I have seen in a long time. this movie was an instant classic when it first came out. If you love to laugh you love this movie. Great action packed movie. The action never stops and the acting is superb. The plot is about a poor farmer who get fooled into acepting beans for his horse. He meets a princess and when the beans get wet, a beanstalk to the land of the giants is created. The movie revolves around the giants and how men of meager size try to fight them off. The graphics are great and the storyline is exciting. This movie is funny, and good for all ages!! Great 3d, beautiful script and a wonderful time! \"I'ma chair, I'ma chair, sit on me\" Bought these cameras for work and they work great! the gold live card allows me to access unlimited internet and games without the hassle of monthly fees I dont thing there is anyone that has not scene at least one of the Alien movies. in my opinion this movie is a classic. original story scary keeps you on the edge of your seat. I have a toddler, need I say more! The vac workers great for all the messes. Wasn't as good as the other x-men movies in the series. Was a little predictable but still a very good movie. I liked the product so much I own two of them now. I now do most of my online communications through my xbox one I loved that it continued the battle of 300. I was entertained just like the original. This one did seem more graphic but so worth it. I'm a big fan of Sparta so this movie is great for anyone who is hooked on this type of movie. It is historical, but it doesn't seem stuffy like some of those 1800 Civil War era movies. If you bought the first one, buy this one too! Had to replace new handle because both knob controls were sticking after one week. Never had this problem before Every tv we own in our home is a samsung never fails. Adds additional plugs and provides USB charging ports. USB ports charge quickly. I have a big back yard -\n",
        "So I'm going to purchase another for the otherside of the yard -\n",
        "Battery last a long time when ur done bring in house and recharge you will never run out of a charge for all day backyard entertainment! Loved Toshiba's Chromebook right from the start with it's fast booting, instant on, great keyboard. Since my primary use for this is for surfing the web, it does just that very well. Works even better because I have a Google account I use frequently. Battery life is good. Display could have been better. Was able to get 100GB Google Drive space for 2 years with this purchase. Was able to hook it to my external bluetooth speaker since the built in speakers are not so great. All in all I enjoy my first Toshiba Chromebook and it is clearly the go to machine when you need to quickly look up something online. Leaves the coffee tasting so fresh every time! I highly recommend using the Keurig brand, the Mr. Coffee one left my coffee tasting weird An upgrade from an old laptop. So far so good. fast, no backlight on keyboard. but thats ok. beatsaudio A+ Needed memory, and this has it. Plus so much more. When you are going to spend 4 or 6 hundered on a laptop? and you see what this has at the price. well worth it! My first HP. Liking it it alot. Bought to cover the wires from the hanging TV. It works great. Gets the job done. Easy better than cutting holes in the wall to hide the wires, especially since we live in an apartment. I needed a new USB drive, and this was the best choice at the time. Its hidden connection avoids contamination or damage, and the USB 3 capability means it will be faster. PNY is a reputable brand I've used before. This is the best movie ever. Action packed and has a huge replay value. I have been using Logitech items for many years and have NEVER been disappointed in them. These speakers exceeded my expectations and once again I am more than pleased with my most recent Logitech purchase.\n",
        "ALSO our salesperson was AWESOME. Friendly, helpful, courteous and everything that you would want when you walk into a store. Thanks so much! Great customer service from start to finish. Trey was simply great. Very knowledgeable and gave me several great options. Good: Follow the setup instructions and what you get is legit 2160p content.\n",

        "Not so good: The movies are kind of pricey and selection is limited.\n",

        "Otherwise it's as advertised so far. a really good family movie with a good story that being greedy is not a good thing Very helpful with the baby, juggling a car seat, baby bag, and everything they have to carry, this product is very helpful. Best console you can buy, more than i expected! Get it Bought this game so the kids have something to play on PS3. I watched my daughter play the Android version on a smartphone and liked the creative aspect of the game but disliked that she was staring at a 4 inch screen for hours at a time. Now we can play on a large screen TV in the family room- so it becomes a much more social activity as now we can take turns playing. Though the game is surprisingly spectator-friendly, there is a co-op mode where the TV screen will split up to four ways to allow for multi player in the same world. Note that this feature will only work on 1080p displays so lower resolution TV owners will be out of luck. Other than that- its the same familiar Minecraft. Charges up your phone in minutes. Great Buy. Omg don't know how I survived without it. Everything has worked flawlessly and has a great picture Bought to hold my cable box. Works good. Supports the weight nicely. I was surprised with 2Tb for such a low price. Great deal. I love it. It was a great buy! My daughter loves it!\n",
        "She uses the blue tooth for telephone conversations &amp; playing I music. A fresh cup of coffe on 2 minutes , what more can u ask for. Definetely a must have for coffee lovers. Overall this was a great product. I have have bought many of the cheaper models and they break easily or don't charge my ipad. Two great moves at one great price. Outstanding move and cast. Fun for the whole family. We have a 50 inch TV. I was a little skeptical about mounting my TV but it it perfect over the mantel. Easy set- up. One of the 2HDMI ports on my TV went out. Now I can use up to 4 devices on that single port. A great value. Everything was exactly as described, great preorder deal. Kids love the movie, I do as well. I don't know how to keep the TV from going into samsung mood. It is great to watch sports! Love the size. Very nice for the price! We love this movie! Love that we can watch the DVD in the car and the blu ray at home! Would recommend it to anyone-especially families with boys! An improvement over the original Kindle. Touch screen is the only draw back. I liked the old switches better. This is an easy to use and setup product with fast bit rate. This movie is awesome!!! The acting, the plot and especially the 3D. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone. I loved this movie it was fun trey songs was the best even if he came out for like 5 minutes it was an interesting movie never got bored fast, up to 7 charge cycles for iPhone; can charge up to 2 devices at once. takes a little while to recharge but understandable with battery size Purchased this as a replacement for our land line. Great phone that has the features we need and many extra. This is saving us a contract with the phone company. Now we only pay for the usage we need at home and have an extra cell phone if needed when we are out. The Samsung 4K is everything I expected. Clear, quality picture\n",

        "Bring on the Football season! The game was so real it was unbelievable!! I would defiantly recommend this game to gamers. The game gives you an adrenaline rush and I was all over the place because I was so into the game. This is an amazing wireless mouse! Is super fast, compact and easy to use. Sleek and stylish to boot. Highly recommend for the person who wants a fast, compact mouse to replace their sluggish one. enjoying it with our grandson,I'm really wanting to play call of duty. Works through thick walls for great speed for web surfing. Provides extra outlets in a room with limited power supply. Read several reviews and decided to purchase these. I was tired of having cords dangling. The sound on these is superb. Has great highs and lows. The only thing I wish is that the ear pieces were the solid foam and not the mushroom ones. If they had that it would cancel out more of the ambient noise. i would use it however i would have to pay to renew the service again. It's a nice tablet. The touchpad is nice to use, I like that it's there. but sometimes while drawing the touchpad element gets annoying... If you're a true dragonball fan then this is totally worth it! Good price and so fun to watch! Plus, it's got cool artwork Movie wasn't as good as the first Taken movie but was still entertaining. It is probably too late due to the age of the daughter, however, I think CPS should be called to protect Liam character's family from the folks looking to get revenge. THERE ARE A GOOD AMOUNT OF HITS AND GUEST APPEARANCES. WORTH THE BUY. although it's a great laptop for the price, the graphic could be better. Great product to have to store information on your computers. Couldnt decide between airbok and mac book pro salesperson helped me choose based on my needs and i couldnt be happier the cd is different for cold play, but it is still great. it was ok i just that megan fox was still in the transformers movie i grew up watching transformers and i have a collection of them so i recomend the movie to a friend I would say that the improved reception is worth it. And it looks better than rabbit ears The Sales representative was very knowledgeable , and he provided additional information in reference to models not in the store ie. discontinued. My daughter loves that she can move around freely. Will Smith hits another one out of the park. His best work is in these kind of moves. Fast moving story line never slows down. All i all a great package. Dylan, Clapton, Young, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison and countless others play a tribute concert to The Band's farewell performance. A two hour music video by legendary filmmaker Martin Scorsese. I love legos and I love this movie. It has a fun story and exciting action. very good microSD card lots of space and it lastes me months. Bought this movie to entertain my kids on a long car drive. It worked. Didn't hear a peep from them for two hours. We were slow to buy this game but now we're wondering why we waited so long. My sons have thoroughly enjoyed playing this game and would recommend it to any child that likes playing the PE version on their phone. Still trying to learn Windows 8. I'm sure someday Microsoft will learn that we are creatures of our environment and don't support change well. I love the way the phone feels whe. Wrapped in leather. I worry about the protection but so far so good I love this product it works very well I recommend this product to anyone I bought this camera for the birth of my first child. it was very user friendly and the projector is a great tool for showing other family members at anytime without needing cables and tv. This holds so many songs and videos. It is compact and I can take it whenever I am on a road trip, even for business meetings.  this Blu Ray is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The connect offers my customers an easy to use system with lots of music options. I am liking the the performance of the product. It seems pretty durable. Love the radio. Love how antenna can be pushed in. The tv was great for my mom's first flat panel. The picture was clear and sharp images. This is a great movie! The adults like it as much as the kids do! The minifigure is a great bonus as well as the 3D Everett \"plague.\" The various formats ensure we can watch it on different types of devices. action in the movie was always there. every good movie What can I say, Ridley Scott has some real winners and some real stinkers. This one falls somewhere in the middle. The sorta prequel to Alien has all the makings of a great, heady, sophisticated Sci-Fi film but is just missing a few ingredrients. The story has some great promise and teases some major terrifying moments and then just feels like a different movie in the second half (no doubt due to the multiple screenwriters they involved and all the rewrites and fixes). The characters are a little too one dimensional and cliche. Michael Fassbender knocks in out of the park as David.....the ships resident Droid. Idris Elba is always great even though I feel like we could have seen more of him. This fridge has a frost free freezer. It keeps my ice cream and other products frozen. The fridge keeps my veggies crisp and my foods cold. the movie kept you interested in it with the action and plot overall a good movie I went to see this movie at the theatre and knew once I watched it that I would have to buy the DVD. Cool freaking game!!! U can learn songs, notes, and chords! If u practice every day u will get better! It's great, easy to install and small size switch. I FOUND THIS LIL PHONE TO WORK QUIT WELL. I WOULD REFER THIS PHONE. This is easily the best movie of the year. The digital copy is great for storing it on the iPad and watching it on a plane. It really good product ever I had! I will recommended to my all friends and family. My Grandson an I play viedo games together and I purchased this joy stick for us to play War Thunder. It is a great product for the price! It was just a fun filled good action movie for everybody.. And it was awesome. Works as advertised. I don't have a new Mac with the aC technology to take full advantage but it backs up just fine My son and friends rented an apartment off campus. Some of the rooms had carpets so they needed a vacuum cleaner. I wanted something reliable and since I already have this model, it was the best choice. It also handles bare floors and brings attachments. I absolutely love this product. I actually bought this for my fianc\u00e9 on our two year anniversary. He loves listening to music and I thought it would be the perfect gift and it was! The battery life is GREAT, he hardly ever charges it, and the volume can get very loud. I am a supporter of this product! While most of the game is the same, the additional features, improvements and game play, still makes this game one to get. Got this for FREE with my PS4 UFC purchase so no complaints. I remember watching these movies when I was younger. Great story line, child friendly and relatable. As an adult I have tears, just heartwarming! easy to set up this product. great for my 70ft home I bought this for my wife since she read the book and wanted me to read it as well so I took the easy route and watched the movie with her lol. the movie kept the attention of the kids, they enjoyed it Loved the previous \"non EA\" versions, but this game is the real deal. Mixes all the great stuff from Fight Night with UFC, if you're a fight game fan, dont miss out. I do not watch a great deal of television so I find streaming much easier and I can Ala cart my content. the remote control has buttons for Netflix Amazon blockbuster Mgo. Setting up a Roku account was very easy and navigation is very easy. I have been using this device without cable television for a month and have been surviving fine I have really enjoyed the iPad Air. It is very light and has a fast operating system. Completely forgot how these went.. Loved these as a kid growing up always wanted my own chucky =) def worth the c watch and better than any new horror movies of late happy with the product and cost to acquire it I recommend it This movie was all my daughter talked about lol. I found myself getting caught up in the movie from time to time. Our Samsung P/C Screen quit working! Replaced it with 27\" AOC, have no complaints! Would recommend this item for a friend. I got this mouse at a decent discount, which was why I bought it. It's got a sturdy build and a good weight to it, though it's a little on the heavy side. The programmable buttons are all pretty easy to get to except for the two buttons on the top, to the left of the main LMB. The software that comes with for setting the mouse up to have specific game settings (which load automatically when you start the game), and for setting up macros, is pretty great and pretty easy to get the hang of if you've ever set up custom controls in a game before. This film took me and everyone by surprise. I don't think anyone had positive expectations leading into this after the terrible TIm Burton/Mark Wahlberg version in 1999. But I went into it with an open mind and was blown away. It was so great to see this world get an origin story and to see how and why the apes evolved. The performance capture technology is breathtaking. Andy Serkis is amazing and that man should be nominated for and Oscar at some point if they will every consider performance capture legitimate. You could see and feel all the emotions that Caesar was experiencing throughout. So convincing. He was even better in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes(which is even better!!) It is very easy to use and simple. It also has a \"high-tech\" look and feel. It does not take hours to figure out how to use and mine has free map updates. I like that it informs you of the up coming street names and how reliable it is. I feel very safe with my Garmin! I only have a few pictures on my phone but so far I like it I was able to purchase this flasdrive for less than $40. It was just what I needed and at a GREAT price! Elegant looking, sturdy, good quality. Protects the tablet well. Keyboard has very good feel. Works great so much to learn about all components. The adventure continues. This movie simply lays out the plot and connects to the other movies in the sequence. not for the student who procrastinates. print speed is not this printers thing My basement was flooded and needed a good dehumidifier. Does a great job.. This is great for what I'm using it for, but if you take a lot of pictures, the next one up is better. This is the best cd made in a long time. I wis . I would have purchased it sooner. He is a great singer. Very simple to use. Great item for anyone. Use k-cups or your own coffee. Good phone, both units work very well, I am very pleased with my purchase. Great movie from start to end. Enjoyed the Dvd extras also. Steam is essential for any computer gamer. They are always offering sales, and during larger sales, you can get games for next to nothing. I have only used the camera a few times , but it is very clear and can be taken anywhere. I am looking forward to using it when I go mountain biking. lightweight and does the job. The keyboard layout requires some time to achieve familiarity. I keep hitting 0 when I want to hit right arrow. the item is awesome in every . the size perfectly works with the sound. no cons to the product i love it!!!!!!!! I was late to the X-men bandwagon. I originally stuck my nose up at it when they first came out. But then I saw X-Men First Class in the theater with my friends and I was sold immediately. So naturally I went back and watched the originals. I loved them all, sans The Last Stand which Im sure no one liked. Im thrilled that all 4 were part of it though and not just a typical trilogy set and then have to get the other one separately. Stunning quality. Easily switches between preset modes like theater, gaming, night time, and more. Has an amazing 1 ms response time which took me a while to fine out. It is a great gaming display and even supports Nvidea 3D vision but I haven't been able to try that yet. It is a little expensive but worth the buy if you are looking for quality.\n",
        "I do wish it had a RCA port since the monitor does sell itself to be a gaming display with the 1 ms response time and the other gaming features. And since most gaming consoles come standard with the RCA cables. my son will never use up the 16GB (fingers crossed) the grandchildren loved this movie, very good movie they loved it This one is way better than the test! Liam is awesome actor So far so good. It has been working very well. I think the exterior material used (faux aluminium) is not strong enough nor dirt resistant enough. It's a bit heavy. Depsite these, I like it very much. I'm satisfied with it for now. However, more softwares should been provided along with it. Excellent featuresv&amp; just how it was expected to be! I really enjoyed this movie is awesome.! Woohooooo This DSLR is really great. the silent shutter and full frame is also great I have no complaints about is camera. The sound quality and comfort of this head set is great. Exciting to hear new material from Chino Moreno of Deftones and it is nice to see another collaboration with him and Shaun Lopez from Far. Completely unique sound from both of them which is nice and refreshing. Album definitely needs to be listened to. I had an Epson that some how uninstalled the scan drive. I tried for a year to get it to work and finally had to plug my laptop into it every time I wanted to scan something - got boring after awhile. now I can print from my cell phone - this is great ; ) This is an excellent case for the price. It only stands up horizontally, however, and the IPAD likes to display many apps in \"Vertical\" mode. I thought everything was all good about this item. Only thing i would say is that it hurts my ears really bad sometimes after long time of using it. The item it overall great and easy packing and traveling with. The quality of the Microsoft controller is so much better than the off brands Didn't expect this movie to be as funny as it was. I haven't noticed the speed of the solid state part of the hybrid drive just because I haven't slowed my computer down with unneeded junk. I has great capacity and still pretty cheap for claiming it has the speed of a solid state drive. A true test would be a fast boot up with a full desktop and start bar and the drive at it's max capacity. Since I don't have that, I don't see any performance drops so it might be a little over priced compared to a normal hard drive. I believe this TV has a lot of potential, but we placed it in a vacation home and have not taken the time to fully set it up. As we gradually work with it, we are finding more features that make it a great purchase. These earbuds work very well, have good quality and have excellent low-end. Great scifi flick love the alien movies this was my favorite of all of them my husband blew up my last microwave and it took over a year to find a new one at a great price. Finding one that our teen could use was a bonus Easy to insert and use. Works great on a Mac. Plays CDs good. Great movie, especially for those of us that grew up playing with legos. Protects my iPod pretty nicely. I like that it is a hard and A gel case. I like the iPhone 5s it's fast like the Touch ID good customer service from the rep very knowlagble Very funny movie which kept me entertained the whole way through. My granddaughter &amp; grandson loved thus movie they both watched it over &amp; over again. Good product to use at home,traveling ,or at work. It was easy to set up and does exactly what I wanted it for Plenty of space for music, apps, and photos. Upgraded from a 16gb to a 32 gb for more space. Great and convenient way to add funds to my xbl account! It is an i7 so it is fast but sometimes unnecessary. It is good for graphic design and heavy graphic renderings but an i5 would be better for gaming if that is what some people are looking for just because an i5 is cheaper but still performs well enough for gaming. If the price came sown a little it would defiantly be a must have. It's a decent hard drive. Nice back up hard drive with lots of space. The movie was great telling the truth about true heroes of our country Good network coverage but need USB port. USB port is missing. These amps are really nice and are easy for my customers to use. Great movie, I would recommend this to my friends, family &amp; co workers. This is a great movie. We saw it in the theatre and had to have it as soon as it came out. The sound quality is great, they fit well in your ear due to the shape which also causes them to be more comfortable than most headphones. The remote is very useful because now, if I want to change the volume or pause the song I don't have to reach in my pocket, pull it out, and everything else. Instead I just reach up towards my neck and press on little button. Though I still think $30 is a high price for just a pair of headphones, I would recommend getting these because they are probably best quality headphones you'll find at a lower price. Because there are still Beats, but who really wants to pay $100 for a little pair of headphones? haha This Chromecast was very easy to install and works great. It allowed me to set up Netflix and now we can watch all the movies we want. I would highly recommend this product. It is an amazing water cooling system for a low price. It wasn't the easiest to install and I had to change the fans and radiator around a couple of times on my NZXT Phantom 410 case. Once I finally got it though it work perfectly and my CPU stays well below the overheating limit. I also thought of overclocking my processor but have not done so yet. That will be the true test to see if it can keep the CPU cool. I like the look of the stand and all the storage wish it was supported more underneath but overall its a nice stand that serves its purpose We needed a flat mount for a small tv This one worked fine! this is a beautiful monitor the pictures are great and the color is popping. extremely good for day to day use, its great for games and movies. the only downside if this monitor is no matter how you install the sundial stand the screen wobbles a little. Great quality for the price. The sound quality is just right. TV is great...love the picture and all the features of the TV...have had no issues with the TV...completely happy with my decision to buy this item  this band is a heavy band with some pretty dark themes to the songs This case looks really nice (I have gold on white iPhone). It's a little heavy/clunky, as I was used to the cases that just pop on and are not much larger than the phone. Also, I don't like that it uses a different kind of charging cord than the iPhone itself; just another thing to remember to take with me when I leave the house (because it takes a different cord, I often forget to charge the whole thing before I go to bed). Why can't they come up with a universal charger? This is a great tv. It had good picture quality and is crisp and bright. Over all it is a great buy. Fits in a mid-ATX case easily and performs well enough for gaming, programming, and digital design. The DVD drive has Apple's aesthetic. I wonder when the next update of the drive will be. just needed a case for my external harddrive and this seems to be perfect for it It's a great value for the price!\n",

        "2. Not a Retina Display It's a movie about a mouse off to find the elusive American Dream. What's not to like? Brought back a load of memories, and made me realize cartoons were much harsher growing up - now I feel old... Ah well. Great story, recommended. Just watch it first before showing it to your younger kids. Bought this game for my nephew, but secretly play myself. took my son to see this movie in theaters and he loved it so much we had to buy it Game is only one player. As a chick it would have been nice if I could've at least TRIED to play with my boyfriend It's not 1080 but for the money it's the best deal in town! It's ours kids tv and they don't need fancy. Great replacement for someone whose dog loves chewing on metal and she chewed up the first one. Just using it for a gift. I like to give these cards because anybody can use them. We bought this model to replace our old Panasonic microwave, which was 100 watts less powerful but still did a great job defrosting, heating and reheating, for 15 YEARS! NO JOKING! After our micro functions started wearing out (it would stop cooking occasionally, and the clock always read 88:88), there was no way we could go wrong buying the replacement model at almost the same low price. The nice part is that cooking and reheating takes a little less time, and popcorn is still one of our favorites to program (we like using Power 70 for 3 minutes in the regular size bag). Panasonic made this microwave to last and perform well! I will always recommend this oven, and it matches all of our white appliances. The Danby 8,000 BTU cools so fast and it's only set to low.. Wow! No more waiting for your old AC clunker to kick in. With the Danby, you'll feel it immediately! Easy setup and the remote makes operating simple. I have already recommended this to my friends. Overall the film was entertaining, it get a little confusing at the end, but the general content was interesting Much better than the original trilogy. Highly recommend this movie to any spidey fan out there. Fast and Great price and best of all no more renting from the cable company . One thing the lights for the internet should be green when connected to the internet, my lights are white. Called the co. And the told me that was normal. It works so I guess that's the way it is. Works as expected, no problems. I would recommend it. just another great movie in the series, love the blu ray version Good movie all around, had no complaints. Two words; Angelina Jolie Excellent movie for people of all ages, highly recommended . The best the beeeeeessssssssttttttt the greatest the best I was a little hesitant about purchasing a portable speaker (mostly because early portable models sacrificed sound quality for said portability), but after bringing this home and setting it up, I couldn't be happier with the purchase! The speaker is small, but don't let its size fool you; the sound quality is on par with a full sized system. Quite pleased overall with the product. I've had this mouse for about a year now and I must say the battery lasts for EVER. I own an imac and have used both the magic trackpad and the mouse(not the magic mouse) and I hated both of them. So, after reading all the reviews on this mouse I decided to give it a shot.\n",
        "I bought it on sale for $14 and I love it. WAY better than the mouse/trackpad that apple offers. Sometimes a basic non \"magic\" mouse is all you need. I do love my imac though.\n",
        "Any way, that is all I have to say about this mouse. Awesome.\n",
        "\n",
        "On a side note, this mouse is a tad bit smaller than the regular mouse. I am 5'10\" and my hands are of average size but it feels just fine and not awkward at all. If you've got big hands/long fingers than this might not be the mouse for you. your loss. lol This item last longer than generic brands. However, it a bit pricey especially when you need ac unit plus charging cord. $ 40.00 plus. .... I love the touchscreen monitor. And very fast start up. Good quality for price. Bright pink color easily identified Moore's first outing as 007 is a little strange compared to the other films in the series. It deals with voodoo and tarot card reading and a drug lord. But still a solid debut for Moore. This movie is absolutely hilarious. It's probably one of the best movies of the year. I would definitely recommend this movie to my friends. Apart from the obvious oversight by leaving the director's placeholder \"unobtainium\" in the script, it's a fairly decent movie that reminds me of a cartoon about trees... It pan. It does exactly what it's supposed to do. Great quality and cleans easy. I liked the actors in this movie. Ice cube portrayed a great police officer. The overall storyline was also great because it was believable and funny. this movie was way better than i expected it to be Great hard drive ! Very easy to use. I hooked it up very easily, did not even ask for help. Lol. It has tons and tons of memory which I like. In an era when so much is shabby, this is a very well made product which affords solid protection for the drives--will hold two (although with two, you will have to put the cables elsewhere). I really don't have anything bad to say about this laptop. It's worked great for me. The battery lasts a good amount of time and once you get used to the 8.1 OS everything is a piece of cake. I love it! So I had boxes and boxes of credit card, bank statements, tons of credit card offers and lots of other sensitive information I just couldn't toss out. It was years of accumulation and most of the information can be retrieve online from my credit card companies and banks.\n",
        "\n",
        "So I got this and spent half a day shredding and I can tell you it survive my marathon. It will overload if your stack is too much or if the container is nearly filling. If it overheats, I have to wait about a hour (Usually less) Overall, this is a keeper and no more paranoid hoarding and since I shred when I need to, no more giant stacks for shredding so the overloading or overheating wouldn't be a problem. It took a lot of shredding to push it to overheat/overload. I wanted a TV mounted wall unit that was reasonably priced and easy to install. The rocketfish met those needs. The new cable box from my cable supplier is small enough that I was able to tape it to the back of the rocketfish. Now all I see is the TV. It's great. Saw this movie twice. Love the action and storyline This was great to do all the crazys activities, like bar hopping, cruises, clubs, all those good stuffs that single people like to do.. A must own for true movie fans, great HD picture &amp; sound. I liked the cord because I could use it to my iPhone. I could also use this for my iPad . I would have to say its universal use. I bought this as my dishwasher is about 5 years old. I try and keep it clean, but there are some areas you just can't. I used this once and I was amazed, my dishwasher looked brand new again, nice and clean! Highly recommend! Replaced my previous 4\" Garmin with this and it has been a great upgrade. Nice screen, clear directions and lots of features in a very well priced package- less than $100 on sale. Bought this game for my daughter , she enjoyed playing it .. I thought this movie wa a great comedy suitable for the whole family. Would recommend to anyone. Not an expensive printer for someone trying to start a small business. True Blood is so much fun to watch. I love the colorful characters. It sounds great but no volume control with the TV remote? great movie for kids and adults. I hope to see future projects with appeal for both children and adults This Acer Chromebook is a great product for the price. I had gotten a tablet after my laptop died, but I missed having a keyboard. I decided to give this Chromebook a try and I'm glad I did. It is a great device for emailing and doing anything online. I didn't care much for the plot but it's all a matter of opinion. Great quality movie The converter replaces a compact Radio-Shack unit with a noisy fan that plugged directly into the cigarette lighter hole. That old unit was hard to fit into the lighter hole as the full unit had to fit wherever the lighter is located.\n",
        "This new converter comes with a coiled cord allowing the inverter to be moved up to 18\" or so away from the cigarette lighter, moving the bulk of the inverter and all the other wires out of the drivers area.\n",
        "Overall, this product is exactly what I had hoped it would be. My daughter loves this game. It is girly enough for her plus she is learning. I picked this up for my mom whose in a nursing home to go with her 32 inch vizio, it great and was a good deal too!! This is a nice little cord. It works great if your device is close by. This is a great microwave. I love that it has the convection option, although, I have not used that option yet, but the microwave is awesome. The popcorn setting is spot on, perfect for the 3.5oz bags. I also like that it has the rack so you can heat up more than just one dish if you need to. Arjona music lyrics always good. great artist i follow! hope he continues to put out great music in future Great picture quality and great series. Well written and entertaining I liked the plot of the movie. The characters were interesting and the actors did a great job. We saw it at the movies and loved it. My kids still watch the DVD a lot. It's a great product. I was able to clean interiors of my car. I also use it in the home , especially kitchen (Time when I break something)\n",
        "\n",
        "Only thing I think it could have had was some sort of long attachment that would have helped users to clean below the seats and even sides.\n",
        "\n",
        "Battery is ok, it usually lasts long to clean you entire car. This is a great charger that chargers my phone quickly. This card will hold a lot of pictures and can be used in many different cameras. Cost is decent Jennifer still makes great music, but the adult theme disaapoints for her overall fan following. still will listen,but hope her futre projects are better suited for her audience Best controller ever. The New feature are exciting Really happy with HP ENVY Touch Smart ..\n",
        "User friendly, love touch screen , 17 inc Big clear Screen . Not heavy to carry around so makes easy travel with ..very satisfied with my purchase ... This product defends my phone from all of the sharp things. I buy these cartridges because they're the ones specified for my printer. they work fine. The only router that will reach out on my deck where others won't . I traded the extreme in for the time capsule . Same router but with 2TB hard drive built in. I knew exactly what I was getting when I went to buy this chromebook. I had done my research and after reading all the reviews I decided to go with the acer c720. I bought this chromebook on sale for $200 and I have no complaints what so ever.\n",
        "It boots up really fast, I use this mostly for browsing, surfing, watching youtube and so on so forth. I know that it isn't HD but watching videos on youtube is very acceptable. The sound is good too.\n",
        "I own an ipad but I would rather use this over the ipad since this gives you the feel of a laptop and it sits better of your lap and the keyboard isn't that bad either. The body is made of plastic, but it feels really rugged and well built, definitely not flimsy at all. If you want something cheap for everyday use then I would highly recommend this. It's great for kids as well.\n",
        "So, basically what I'm trying to say is, that the acer c720 is a great $200 machine and it doesn't burn a hole in your wallet. My grandchildren love anything to do with ninja turtles and this keeps them occupied as they get so engrossed in the story line Love the books, and the movies are entertaining and well done My son loves this game! Its fun and keeps him entertained. He especially likes that there are many vehicles to unlock and characters too. Overall nice design, and works well while running, no issues with slipping It fits easily in my pocket, yet has a large screen.\n",
        "The camera is very good.\n",
        "The phone is strong, even without protection. I purchased this item as a Father's Day gift. My husband is very pleased. Great movie, Not as good as the orginal but i grew up watching this Replaced factory radio and this made the transfer seamless Very good quality tapes, I use them to film skateboarding and various projects like weddings, etc and defiantly a good buy and deal locally for dv camcorders This is a plain tablet cover so there isn't much to say other than it works fine and hasn't torn yet. I put over 4000 songs on it and there is still room for photos. Sometimes car charging may be a solution and the outlets on the walls may not be there for you to charge that dying phone. I bought this solely to keep my phone and ipad going when I need that juice. Works great and keeps about 3-4 charge for my Note 3 Love the style of the camera, nice pictures but camera is very fragile. Replaced factory radio and this made the transfer seamless Couldn't ask for a better moniter for busines and everyday use. I do not intend to use it for anything extremely technical, like graphics, but great for creating and reading documents in general. Functionally great also--size, weight. Best of all it was easy to set up on my eight year old Dell XPS laptop, which could have easily been a nightmare. If you need a moniter for a better view of what is on your laptop screen, this one is fabulous! Solid unit. Travels well and is compact enough that it is easy to take on business trips This system is incredible for the money, deep thumping lows in cinema mode along with great high and midrange coverage.\n",
        "You could spend over twice the money and still not get as good a system I recently picked up sniper elite III. I thought overall that the game had a decent story and was fun to be sneaking around sniping at the right moments of sound cover up. There are multiple ways to play this game the way u choose. I'm currently still working on beating this one but so far so good! I've personally played all of this sniper series and the xbox one version is amazing! I bought my boyfriend this character stand to go along with a beats pill and it was the perfect combo. Perfect gift for any age. I love my tablet. It is my first tablet. It was a little tricky for me at first but then I got used to its many features. I love that its like a mini PC. very convenient Got this after seeing one my husband was given. It is a great addition for\n",
        "both my phone and my ipad. I can use use it when running and it does not have cords to deal with and slap me when running. It fits comfortably and has several ear buds to find the best fit. It is easy and comfortable when using in the car for the blue tooth features. Looking forward to getting familiar with all the smart &amp; wi-fi features. This was bought open box. A little hard to configure without the Manuel but overal great product I am new to the Mac world and had been leaning towards a Dell but I am glad I decided to get the MacBook Air. The processing speed and boot/shutdown time is amazing. I use this laptop to DJ and haven't had any issues with running my DJ software as well as running other apps at the same time. The USB devices I connect are instantly recognized and function without interruptions. Replaced factory stereo and was told this was needed for Sirius xm integration, which is true, BUT...the one year trial from Sirius that came with new vehicle will not transfer from Sirius...you have to buy a new subscription I really do like this Defcon Combo lock. It's simple to setup, easy to use and seems very sterdy in construction. I recently decided to shave my head and realized that razors were going to send me to the poor house. So I researched electric shavers and came across this model. I have been using it 3-4 times a week to shave my head and it has performed awesome. I have thick coarse hair and it cuts skin tight with relative ease. I have been extremely happy with this product and would recomend it to anyone looking to go with the clean look!!  Very easy to use the set up was flawless and I like the compactness of the unit. I like the WiiU. I purchased it for my son. He loves to play on it. I think it is very kid friendly and a great system for a child Replaced factory radio and this made the transfer seamless I purchased the players as a distraction for my 19 month old grandson during a long road trip. The players worked like magic for both he and his Grandma while I drove across Colorado and Kansas.\n",
        "The players were easy to install, fit as expected, and performed as intended. Either player can be the \"master\" or the \"slave\" if you want to view the same DVD on both screens. The cables are very generous, allowing power to be connected at the dashboard and watch video in the back seat. Note that the unit is noisy, and when combined with highway road noise, the volume struggles to be enough. For the next trip, I will feed the audio output into the car sound system to boost the volume.\n",
        "Based on the 4 days of use, this seems like a fine product for the money. Very different than what I was expecting. But was still a good movie Replaced factory radio and this made the transfer seamless This is an excellent product, super light easy to use, exceeded all of my expectations. Thank you Lifeproof My fingers are big and I constantly tap 2 keys at a time so this allows me to be much more precise in what I am trying to type with less errors. I bought this camera for a college student.He feels so comfortable and convenient in doing his work. assigned work. Purchased for my husband for his birthday. He loves it. It's an updated model of our older one. Powers surround speakers, sub and ceiling speakers perfectly. Replaced factory radio and this made the transfer seamless This product seems to be reliable, fast and accurate. Love the sleek design. Very user friendly. Love it Eddie Murphy at his best, funniest movies, nonstop laughter. This is the best headphones ever on blast u can't hear nun Great cd to listen to while driving. Aslo got a free Affliction shirt with the purchase.....that was awesome !! Light weight headphones that provide clear and crisp sound Will Ferrell the funniest man on the planet, nonstop laughter This album truly highlights all of the members talents and is a perfect soundtrack to the crazy road we call life. The lyrics are very relatable and the album itself is easily the best album of 2014. I originally saw this TV in an email and immediately liked the price. It had less features than other TV's of the same size made by other brands, but that didn't matter. I didn't need anything fancy. The set up was extremely easy and quick. In less than 30 minutes, I was watching TV....And I love it!!!!! Now my search begins for a new dvd player... I got this mouse when it was on clearance so it was virtually a steal\n",
        "Easy to setup and use...no issues as of yet...very smooth When Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are the same movie you it's going to be funny I love my new camcorder and when i needed more memory this is what i grabbed ! Love it, so easy to use. Since I was looking to archive a very large mail file, this USB stick on sale was perfect. Remember USB 2.0 is very slow if side by side to a USB 3.0 stick so if your going to constantly copy and retrieve files I recommend a USB 3.0 for a little more money. If your archiving like I was, this is perfect. We bought the Sonos soundbar and placed it on a table about 6\" below the TV. However there were some thin wires that showed.\n",
        "This wall mount enables you to wall mount the soundbar so that it sits just below and against the tv hiding all wires. Like all Somos components thd quality is amazing. It comes with a template and mini size level to make the installation easy and perfect. I love Sonos! I needed more storage and this was recommended to me and it was definitely a good buy Overall, I like the headset although I only used it a few times\n",
        "Fits on fine and can hear just fine as well\n",
        "Good buy if you want to get something cheap One the great classics nonstop laughter and greatness from Joe pesci Picture-perfect\n",

        "Look: slim and light weight with old model stand. The purchase of this case is perfect for the person who will drop there phone a lot in its entirety. I love the new windows. I like the fact I can see two screens side by side. It is alittle to get use to for us still using vista. But I love it Works great! Exactly what I needed! It replaced the one we lost for our iPad. Great three pack to have, nonstop laughter, jack black is great in all three films Overall, I think this product is wonderful and fun. This is a great TV movie prequel to the battlestar reboot. My dad was very great full for the Father's Day gift. Also, the sale price was very generous. I love it. It is very fast and easy to use. I was skeptical but I am glad I bought it. This memory stick was very easy to install in my gateway desktop. I do not really do much work on computers so I was a little worried at first trying to install it, but it was very simple. This product has worked well and has done a good job in increasing my processing speed. Nonstop action from beginning to end.good follow up from taken 1 Really good comp for a fair price working really fast powerful, small-footprint compact computer greatly suited in limited workspaces... Simple, light, and easy to use. Convenient and affordable! Best Bluetooth ever. It sounds great, very light and easy to pair. Truly a must .... If you need a Bluetooth . I think it's the best movie Kevin costner had made good Acton movie. it has been great at protecting my computer. I have been very pleased A refreshing new story. It's nice to see a good movie not created by Ghibli making its way out of Japan. After comparing models, I finally decided on Flex. It took a few days for the device to sync with my schedule, but I haven't had any major complaints. It is easy to wear and I can change the bands out to match outfits when I feel the need to coordinate. The app is really easy to use on my iPhone and I love that it syncs with myfitnesspal. It is also appealing that I can access my account online if my phone isn't an option. My kids love tapping the band to see how many dots I have for the day. I don't use the sleep tracker as often, but I have been overall satisfied with the results when I do. As with any of these fitness trackers, they are not perfect, but do help give a general idea of activity/sleep. Should be wider to make it more stable while in the charger, but is still an outstanding addition to my tablet. Great game, husband is still playing and enjoys the challenge it's bringing, keeps him busy. Lol Have heard,from others how good this machine is. After a stubborn period of successive purchases of inferior products, I finally took the advice of \"all jobs are easier with the proper tools\" and bought this Tyson. I've been playing wolfenstein since the original. When it first came out for the computer. I'm glad that it was recreated into a newer first person shooter. I personally liked this game alot after going threw the whole campaign. Alot of action and always on the edge of your seat suspense with the option of going threw guns blazing or stealthy and silent. If u like first person shooters with alot of intense moments, must get! Great movie, suspenseful and thrilling, good cop movie to have. My purchase of the Samsung 48\" HDTV was such a great purchase. It has very smooth &amp; clear picture quality. It makes me want to rewatch every single bluray I own. I'm very happy and pleased with product, my husband is in love with the system, best anniversary gift for him. Very nice, great bass. Works we'll inside, outside and in the Carr. I can complain at all about this bag!! I picked it up while it was a daily special and about half the normal 70 or so price tag..I had just gotten my very first Mac product and wanted something that could carry the macbook without a ton of extra room on the sides. I also wanted something durable, and a messenger style bag. This fit the bill 100%....looks great, and it has plenty of spots for other items to carry along....its smidge slim on the inside..other than 100% perfect bag, great compliments from everyone! Cool and easy to use. Always a must to have one!!! great printer with color monitor. i brought it for 89.99 Easier to program the addresses. Nice feature about \"what's up ahead\" that let's you know how far to food or gas stations is very helpful. In the event you take it on a trip and lose a suction cup or cord you can get parts at the local store. No hassles with online ordering. I am very satisfied. Good value for the money. It's great thrilling show with nonstop Acton.best show ever. Outstanding protection for the tablet screen. No way I'do own a tablet without one. I love this watch it is so much better the first gear,I can customize my home screen, the battery life is way better, more apps easer to work. You can't go wrong with this buy. Camera ceased working correctly after 6 weeks. Replaced with new phone under warranty. Great way to try new games! Monthly releases of free games. This is my second samsung tablet. My first is the Galaxy 10.1 and I prefer this Galaxy 8 Pro. The screen is much better and it is smaller and lighter. I don't use it myself for gaming but my kids do and they prefer this one over the larger one mainly because of the screen quality. It is fast and I haven't had any issues with it yet. I purchased this on sale and am very happy with it. Awesome remote but the battery charge doesn't last as long, as I would like. If that makes sense Pretty responsive but wastes batteries. Theres no way to charge the battery while playing. Overall, my daughter loves it!! I have the lovely black and white pattern case. It's sturdy enough yet still has an elegance to it so that the Mini doesn't appear or feel heavy and clunky. When used as a stand, it's sturdy. Wonderful product. Perfect for my use. Fits perfectly in my front pocket. Also provides great protection for my phone. The UP24 is easy to use and track steps and sleep. It syncs easily with the iPhone. The band charges for over a week! Great cover for the Samsung Galaxy Tab. I had this for a prior tab, had to have it for the new one! Bought for my sons IPad mini and it protects and works great for using as a stand. Though I mainly use it for the Xbox 360 as a portable storage unit, I could use it for manly of other things... though I probably won't just because it is currently serving it's main purpose. Got it for a steal too ($19.99), I'm happy with it. I originally bought this for my son's computer until his computer failed. I used it as a second monitor for my other computer using the HDMI. The colors looked great compared to my Acer monitor I have. Because the monitors were mismatched I decided to buy another one for a dual monitor setup. The colors matches perfectly on both monitors. I also like the feature HP mydisplay. It will divide the monitors into different quadrants. Great for nas unit. Have not had a problem with it yet. I bought this iPad Mini to help familiarize me with apps that I'll be using in my classroom. It's easy to use, has a great assortment of apps, and is a great size. I've participated in webinars, done email, posted on fb, Tweeted, installed and used apps, listened to music, taken pictures. All easy as pie! I'm in love with my iPad Mini. It has become much more than a tool to keep me up to speed at work. I would have given 5 stars except for the price. I saw similar fans at other stores for less, but I like the online ordering and delivery. Wife and I loved the movie! Chris Pine was great as usual! Upgrade for a previous Samsung Galaxy Tab. Works like a charm &amp; the newer features are outstanding. Just gotta figure out the sync issue. Great graphics, smooth controllers, better choice than xbox. However, can not store videos for the kids on the unit Works well with lap top computer, cell phone and tablet for connecting external speakers. Good sound My iPad Air is a lot more advanced than my first generation iPad. I love the sixe and the 3D display. It is faster, also. I love this movie its really funny, my niece love. WORKS GREAT AND DOES THE JOB THAT IT WAS INTENDED TO DO. These phones were easy to charge and set up. These are a nice size and have been effortless so far. I am extremely glad that I bought the dvd. I have no regrets; it's worth it. I have watched it a number of times already. It's entertaining and well made. It's great to see a different part of Jack Ryan's life. I love Tom Clancy and the Jack Ryan novels and although this was not based on a specific book, I think they tried to stay true to Ryan's character. While this film is not as good as wedding crashers, I was pleasantly surprised and entertained laughing out loud several times. You know what you are getting with these two and it works. Finally a movie that I am happy to let my daughters watch without worrying about the typical damsel in distress trope I bought my Kindle Paperwhite to take with me to the beach this summer and be able to read my favorite books, I have very happy with my purchase. The Kindle is awesome and I will be using it a lot this coming year This has been an easy product to get used to. It's easy to get to my favorite apps. This is a fun movie for all, the whole theater was a buzz after the show. I wouldn't change anything except to include Itunes download as well.\n",
        "I can't wait for another one I bought this to replace my Hp PhotoSmart C8180, which was a great printer and did everything I needed it to do for my business. It finally wore out after quite a few years, and I am delighted that I chose this printer to replace it. great for stereo----cheap and best\n",
        "great for stereo----cheap and best I love this dvd, Better then batman trilogy. Excellent does what it supposed to do................................ Gray product for the sale price that I purchased it at. This was a great buy, its durable and the price was right. This was a great purchase. It allows us to have music playing while we are outside enjoying our backyard. great for stereo----cheap and best\n",
        "great for stereo----cheap and best does what its supposed to do..................................... This was a great buy, its durable and the price was right.  This CD is great! I love the songs on this CD more than the songs he sang at his concert in July, 2014! the lego movie is so funny it was way better than I expected it to be... This is a great CD! I bought this a week or so before the concert. Love it! Purchased it for PS3 connection. Original Cables weren't snug and gave a feed back. Installed these and Audio/Visual Quality improved dramatically. No more feed back. Bought this tv as a gift for my father. Fit perfectly in his man cave and great value Good starter tablet for children. Easy to navigate with a good screen size. Just got this case and the fit is great. I love that you can talk on the phone with the screen covered. The case itself doesn't get greasy from use and the smart circle feature is pretty slick. At first, I was confused about application of the case...this case snaps on over the back cover, you do not remove it. You have to get the case the explicitly states \"wireless charging\" to get the replacement back feature. I actually contacted LG and they were also confused and told me to remove the back. Wrong. My 20-year old daughter actually picked this out, but we all absolutely love it! Blake Shelton has put out a great CD. Definitely worth purchasing. Works very well. Bought it for my Grand-daughter's I phone. I bought this laptop for my daughter in college and she loves it. It is easy to use and very light to carry around. Great case that holds 2 flash drives. Like that it has an attachment to attach to a key chain. For the thinker and visual learner. Entertaining to the end. Computer is great. Glad to have it. Easy to use and work on. I really enjoy my Blu Ray .because not only can I watch Blu Ray movies. I can watch Netflix too I needed an SD card for my Nook HD and this fits the bill. Great mouse for travel or daily use. Compact transmitter perfect to leave in and not get lost. If you like Iron Man or like action, this is a must see movie! This is a great flash drive packed with alot of storage space in a small compact size. Generally great TV. I didn't need anything SMART for whatever and is perfect for the bedroom. One thing that can be improved on is that it hums when volume is below a certain level. It's more noticeable when I'm up close but can't hear it when I'm farther away. Other than that, great value and quality for $180 when I bought it! Love this movie. BB has some great sales. I do wish there was a bigger selection at the store but oh well. This was my first Blu-ray movie and it looked fantastic. Holds lot of photos. I'd say at least 1000. I love it ibecause Im always shooting photos, sometimes as many as 200 at once. If i go on another shoot in the next day or two I need that extra room. I don't always remember or have the time to go through and upload and delete my photos after a shoot. The large capacity is great for me Funny movie for all ages. Brought back memories of my childhood playing with legos. Hey, it's decent. Works fine, does what I bought it for and that was for extra drive space for my Xbox One that now allows the use of an external hard drive. Over the moon about it? Not really, but it's probably great for the laptop it was intended for... This is a great product if you want media screening directly to your T.V Works well has great air flow. We use it in kids bedrooms when it is warm out. I also take it to work for my desk. I love this show it's great, it is something I deffinately recommend Simple but very useful with my Samsung Galaxy note 8!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Does all the functions that was wanting. Works better then old one. I bought this to take on a 7 day cruise. Works great!!! Stays charged a long time. It charges phones and tablets faster than I thought it would. Great buy for the price. If you need protection for your Paperwhite, this does the job. The sound quality is great! The fit is nice!!! Overall great product! IT SUITS MY NEEDS AND DOES THE JOB IT WAS INTENDED TO DO. I love this show it's great, Great packageing I definitely recommend ! Superb batterylife. It fits into my back pocket so I have it whenever I want to read. Paper white makes it extraordinary to read in almost any light. Small great sound, price is ok, bass is good as well Got this for my 9 year old and she loves it. Won't put it down until it's dead then once it's charged enough to turn back on it is in her hand on the charger. It's very easy for her to navigate through, but who am I kidding everyone knows that kids know more these days about phones. It has enough memory for her to have music, tons of games and unlimited pictures of her and her friends. Absolutely love the fact that I can print payroll and no one can mess up my checks I purchased this guide as a present, and apparently they preferred the digital guide and tricks they have found online. This is the second pair of Sony earbuds that I've owned. This new set, which looks alot like the old set, is not as good as the old ones due to the lack of a volume control. However, the buds are comfortable in the ears and I really like using them at the gym while working out. The sound quality is ok...definitely not top of the line, but functional. All in all, I would say that these are pretty good earbuds. I love this show it's great, I love the package it comes in it's great ! My computer fans are rated at ~16 dBs, so i figured that 40 DB in a dishwasher would be pretty loud, so we bought the quietest one we were willing to spend money on.\n",
        "Boy was I wrong, this thing is so quiet that I have no idea it is running unless my ear is right up against the machine. Well, I can hear the water being ejected too. But that is pretty low as well.\n",
        "The unit looks great.\n",
        "The unit is high quality and solidly built.\n",
        "I am not really a dishwasher kind of person, pretty much all the dishes that go into it are already cleaned of any food stuff and just really need a little soap to get rid of the last bit of residue and oils the foods leave behind.\n",
        "The only real issue I have with it thus far is that the middle rack got out of the track or something and prevented it from closing. I spent a long time trying to figure out what was preventing it from closing, then I decided to see if I could remove the rack, and while it did not come out, it had a moment where it adjusted and when i rolled it back in it went slightly further back and finally started closing properly again. Bought them to record some jazz music to play in my car. Worth every penny! !!! Great TV for the price.. Excellent easy if set up &amp; no need to fish wth color changed .. Very sharp picture . Overall great TV for the price On vacation, we shot over 650 digital photos and had over 400 left. At home, we just plug the card into our MacBook and instantly make a DVD to share with friends! This movie was great! It was easy to follow, and flowed seamlessly into the Marvel universe. Extra features were cool too!! Would recommend this to any other comic book or Marvel movie fan!! Love the fridge. It's big enough to hold everything for canning season and I'm waiting to see what it can do during the holidays. Only down side is the amount of space needed for proper ventilation on the right side. Good thing I read the manual. Ended up swapping a cabinet to give it enough room. Not sure how big of a deal it is, but it's better to be careful. Plus my contractor wasn't finished installing yet. This is my second Acer monitor and I have no problems with either one. Both are very good monitors so far. Price was very good too compared to other name brands. I don't use the \"features\" so I cannot comment on those or what they might be. I won't hesitate to buy additional Acer monitors as the need arises. I have never had a problem with my printer because I use the ink that was made for it. Works the best, no ink leakage or mess Classic sound from a great artist. Deffinately recommend. It was easy to install, but copying a lot of data to it took a really long time. Other than that, the performance is great. Use it as a Media storage device for streaming to various devices. the memory card does what it is suppose to do. Great I use the XL Ink for my Brothers printer. It last for a long time\n",
        "and the price is not bad. great noise cancelling buds for the price. they keep clean and do not tangle. perfect for extending bike rides. The product is everything that I hoped for. Would purchase this product again. This is a great family movie, my kids love watching it! This is a beautiful pen and stylus together. Everyone that see's it likes it. Ink was easy to replace. Seems to last long enough for the limited printing I do. We purchased the sony controller for the ps3 to replaced the one my son broke. So far works great and I love the camouflage pattern. I'm enjoying my new system and most of all iradio I would recommend this to my friends. This system has allowed to Caragh? Phone and other devices will least amount of problems. If all you want is a reader with lots of book access this will satisfy you the device was great to transfer the data from my old computer to my new computer. made things so easy and it did exactly what it was supposed to do. This case was purchased to protect iphone and it is working just fine. Great sound for the price and size of the speakers. I only give it 4 stars though because the midrange could be better. They use horns for treble which is a different sound then from a traditional speaker. Bass is very good but not overbearing. I do have them mounted in the corner of a soffit out on the patio though so the bass could be getting some help from the reflections. Also, I am powering them with an old power amp I have so they are getting plenty of power, this makes any speaker sound better than an average receiver can do. we looked for a fan for garage and porch use and it works great keeps everyone sitting at the table cool If you go into this movie with an open mind you will enjoy the story it is trying to tell. A little too heavy on the religious beliefs for me but overall an entertaining film for the whole family to enjoy &amp; wonder what happens after death. Thought it was a good movie. Don't pay for the theater. Always wait for video. I wanted to get this for my husband. It helps him keep track of his daily exercise and is easy to use and read. He syncs it to his phone and logs on periodically. I definitely believe this is a product that's worth the money! Excellent action packed movie. Great cast, great acting. Excellent charcters. Original storyline. Actors were good. I purchased this drive to store professional photos and keep a continuous back up. It is much better than the online backups and much easier to retrieve files. Not to easy to navigate but not to difficult but with lot of features. Decent shredder for the price. Does the job if just shredding junk mail, printouts, and credit cards. Try to keep the papers to a minimum (4-6 sheets at a time). The shredder gets jammed if you try to put 10 sheets through it so must be patient. Be ready to empty it after a week or two of shredding. Overall, its a good buy if used mostly at home or in the office. Perfect case for iPhone 5s. Great coverage from falls. Have not tested water protection. Love Kaspersky, it is a better virus protector than all the others. Great Sci-Fi thriller that actually makes you think. Rebecca Hall is great as Johnny Depps wife. She really gives a great performance &amp; carries the movie. Great ending. I was skeptical at first because i'm a Bose fan but the moment I tried it, it's really for keeps. I purchased this because my son is a Beats fan and we just tried it if it have an amazing sound and if not will return it but my son was right it's more than what I 'm expecting with this speaker. So if you're looking for a portable speaker with great sound don't look any farther. This is the speaker for you. this is a big upgrade for me and I really like it. it has good speed. This works very good. It is light weight and charges my phone very good. It has come in handy several times when I needed it. Very good for vacation. I bought this because the projector I was looking for was out of stock. I'm very happy that made this purchase. I installed it in my summer rental and everyone is satisfied with the picture quality and features. Watching movies on here is amazing! Bought these headphones for a trip to Europe. The were just what I needed. Comfortable and kept the noise out when needed. I would definitely recommend this to others! My drying time has been cut in half. When I dropped my iPhone in the sink at Denali park, I was glad the LifeProof case protected it. these work great and are comfortable to wear. They pick up very good and I forget I have them on. This movie is hip, funny, and wonderfully entertaining. I'm surprised (and delighted) that they were able to work so many pop culture referrents (that bridge generations) into the plot. This is an a excellent printer easy to use, and I don't have any trouble to install, easy everything, and is faster and is not heavy I recommended this printer Epson. I buy pre-paid phones and slip in my contract sim chip in the phones when they get old, broken or stop functioning. Bought this phone to replace a pre- paid Nokia 521 that stopped charging with a very short battery life. This phone is much better and Battery life is much longer. Works well for our purposes no issues at all. Easy to set up and use no complaints so far...the picture quality is good and the camera is easy to operate After looking all over the place for this, I was glad to find it. It is very handy in my classroom. Works well for what I do but could be a little faster. A pleasure for anyone who likes action movies and Arnold surrounded by a group of good actors, this movie was more about him and less about the other actors, I think anyone who is an action movie fan, and an Arnold fan would enjoy this....so give it a shot. Very easy to use. Unlike the ipad, the samsung galaxy tab has no restrictions. I like the idea of being able to open word documents. I use this TV for travel with my Xbox 360. I love how slim it is and the base comes off easily for transport. The picture is crystal clear at a fraction of the cost of the big boys. It's great! I needed a new one for my bedroom. Thanks I bought 2 of these for my kids in college. The packaging that the Lenovo Yoga 2 comes in is secure and sturdy. The laptop components are easily accesable and the user guide is easy to understand. The built in functions of this laptop are second to none. Added MicroSoft 8.1 office and there is nothing that cannot be accomplished using this computer. The best part is it is i7 solid state, which means it will last for many years and even though new computers come on the market this will be fast enough for them, with memory that will last them all 4 years in school. Overall great product. One thing I don't like but live with is the switch for the volume does not function. great Internet Security easy set up and works on multiple device that is a big plus This product does the job. Quality is great. Had this product before and it protects your phone  Great product. Worked well for burning songs for CD's. Great price Generally pleased with this for on the go travel purposes. It has the features I needed, including offline GPS for navigation. After finally finding the cover, and having one of the wonderful blue shirts put it on, it is working great. Thank you so much. Our Main AC Broke and the Techs wouldn't be back for 2 days.\n",
        "This unit was great cooling our small bedroom at night so we could sleep. Bet gaming mouse ever! The button are smooth!!!! ! I bought this tv for our kitchen as the old one went kaputz. The color is great. The size is great. The only thing is the volume when put to its highest is not that loud. Test it in the store before you buy to make sure great service for multiple devices that help out when there is any problems These less expensive BOSE headphones are very good, but not great. They are comfortable on the ear and are therefore good for long plane rides. I havent used the iphone/ipod adapter buttons or microphone features yet. Everything about this movie was great, Emmet is awesome! CAN'T GO WRONG WITH SANDISK,GREAT VALUE AND PRODUCT!!! I bought the frame to make my GoPro a little less boxy. Its easy to install and will allow for clear audio. It works well and it does it's job. It's neat item. I love Webroot as it does not bog down system resources...you can't even tell it is running. I have used this brand on numerous devices Easy to use but not as expensive as an iPad. It is nice. This small speaker has deceptively great sound. Can easily fill a room. Very pleased with my purchace When I saw trailers for this movie, I knew I had to have it. Super fun to watch, I love Wes Anderson's filming style. Needed a tv to replace the old one in my bedroom to watch at night, was very pleased with the high quality of both the picture and sound. Item was easy to set up Has protected the unit from my 4 year old so far. Doesn't block any controls. Great product for the price. It works fine for pet hair and clean up of the hair in the bathroom daily after styling my hair. The ease of the voice control is awesome! Every device should have this. This is a cool sci-fi movie with pretty good special effects. If you like sci-fi you'll like this! I love this movie! Such a classic :) Watched it a couple of years back and fell in love with it. Ellen Page did a phenomenal job. I was skeptical at first about this case and not sure about it. Since getting it, I have changed my mind. It's a great case. Feels like any other Pokemon game, still amazing but does get reparative over time. i was shocked that this 8' tube put out so much bass!!!!!!\n",
        "\n",
        "bazooka is old school but under rated I've been purchasing my computatoe and printer,and printer ink since we lived in Florida Amazing Cinematography! Lots of action, perfect guys night movie. These are a great deal. My second pair (first one broke because I shut it in the car door). Good sound, mike works great, stays put. These headphones really work! I actually enjoy flying now where I'm not focused on the annoying engine noise and can listen to music or watch movies without distraction and that really helps pass the time. Great, classic 70's album. If you are an Elton John fan, it is a must have! This is a great product, took it on a 4 week trip so that I could unload my DSLR's memory card. Definitely gets the job done, however I would have really liked to be able to use different cables with it rather than the short one that was supplied.\n",
        "\n",
        "Other than that its perfect! Purchased the ipad for my father for his birthday and he loves it. He takes it to his meetings and uses it for work and play. He's a doctor and it works great during his breaks when he wants to catchup on his favorites shows and movies. Overall, it is a great buy for the price I got it at. Works very well. Listen to music while at work with it. I've had this TV for a few months now and am very pleased. It was very affordable and the picture quality is great as are the streaming features (i.e. Netflix). If you're looking for a new Smart TV, I would definitely recommend this! This is a fun movie with good special effects. It's a different twist on Ab Lincoln and vampires. This is the second Lg TV I have purchased we have had no problems at all its a great product Hilarious can't wait for the sequel. Many laughs, great for adults and kids. Lego Batman was my favorite character. I use these to budget myself for the big Steam sales and they work just like cash. Not much else to say about em. Not sure what to say about it. It stays on the night stand, in place, keeps the cables from falling in the floor. This iPad is great. I use it for school. Thank you! Works better than I expected. Length is perfect. I can leave it on my deck and still talk. Love the story of Sherlock and this movie did it justice. Excellent Sequel. Just plugged it in, installed the software and done. Set up a schedule and it does everything automatically. This product was really easy to setup and has a great picture! Cannot ask for much more! Great purchase, no problems with it at all! Haven't stopped playing it, bought Pokemon with it. If you love challenging platformers that are hard but fair, look no further. This game has it all: superb game play, incredible music, wonderful at direction, and awesome graphics. Do yourself a favow and BUY. THIS. GAME! NOW!!! Great fan, keeps us cool. I would recommend buying it. the shield protects the phone from scratches and dirt. Worked well with my laptop - easy to install and will protect against viruses. We bought this particulate tv because it fit in the cabinet in our living room. We like that it has a very minimal cabinet so we got the largest picture for the space. The picture quality is as good as the other models we considered of similar size. Easy to use light weight great camera fun cover case I loved it and its a great product and i would recomend it to all my friends Works as designed. Easy to put on and comes off easily if needed. Best if you buy a back cover protector for the back of the iPad as well. This is a protector made of material for my laptop - seems very flimsy; but, has so far worked. I go through a lot of cables. This cable fits great in my life proof case. It is a very durable cable. A definite must-have for all eight pin users. I didnt know hpw bad my tv sounded until i plugged this in. Great sound. This sturdy case gives me confidence that my 9 and 10 year olds won't immediately break the kids iPad any time soon It's my first smart phone and It works for me just fine My son loves Legos and now after watching this movie my whole family walks around singing everything is awesome! The device works good, connects fast and clear when making calls. Will Smith's acting skills have steadily impressed me over the years and he's become one of my favorite actors. I admire the story, although it does have some very sad moments. It's rare that I buy anything on DVD anymore, but this was one movie I wanted on disc, in a box, with a cover...instead of just a \"download\" or whatever. I love the size and ease of working with this. Works great!\n",
        "Looks nice!\n",
        "Love it!!!! I have recommended this to my friends. Portable light weight Had this about 2 months and it works like a champ so far. First USB 3 drive, which is nice with new laptops support for usb3. Much faster than previous USB drives. Great movie! Kids love it. I was able to use the Blue Ray in the house and the DVD in the car. The digital copy for the tablet. I love the 3 packs... Awesome deal. Best case on the market. Great style and quality. Mophie products are truly remarkable. We puchased this controller for our 5 year old. It's kid safe! Small, portable, light weight computer that opens and folds in different ways. I recommend this charger. It charges almost as fast as an actual apple charger. I was given this razor as a Christmas gift, don't think I would have purshed it myself. I do like it a lot, just not my personal choice. A nice intercom system is part of this phone. Easy to program, lots of features. This washing machine has been great. The large capacity even could handle our bedroom comforter. I love this CD. Keith Urban's greatest hits is a must buy I purchased this radio because mine crapped out. I love it! For the price it has great features and I can connect my iPhone into it and listen to my much from iTunes. Well worth it! Fantastic Film, I love what they did with this classic story. Great music for the price. My son really enjoys the music. Excellent charger for my apple device. I am highly satisfied! I have never been a Mac user...until now. I thought I would try it out and all I can say is that everything runs smoothly and the design is super sleek...love my MAC I love the Rocky series. I love how well they brought it into the present with Blu-ray. They picture are sound are wonderful. The extras are more than I could ask for. And the case is a real space saver. Great quality and lasts for a long time. Love me cannon printer Easy to understand why this game got game of the year. Really fun to play and adequately challenging. I've had this monitor on my desk for a solid 3 months now and love it. I mainly use it to play Diablo 3, and for movie watching.\n",
        "\n",
        "There's a plethora of setting options, and with a little tweaking, it's clarity is surprising. My son loves these speakers. They are perfect for his dorm and the sound is outstanding This is an overall great body fit monitor. It syncs with My Fitness Pal to allow for easy menu tracking. This can be used by individuals that are beginner exercisers and competative athletes alike. Love these hits.. Three CD's with all the hits from my younger days. Brings back many fond memories. was looking for s cheap option when the original keyboard and mouse malfunctions and was pleasantly suprised to find such an affordable pair that was easy to install and work excellently I have had three other cables previously and none were as durable as the rocketfish. I recommend it to anyone who needs a good replacement charging cable. Worked well and was available when I couldn't find one anywhere else! The Lego Movie is a fun film for all ages, and as a man in his late twenties who grew up building Legos, was a wonderful trip down memory lane. The film is very clever, using the building blocks in smart ways and never coming across as a commercial for the products. The idea of conformity versus being creative is an important lesson for kids and adults alike, and the humor hits all the right notes. The voice acting is delightful, especially Will Arnett as a self-absorbed version of Batman and Liam Neeson as a cop with multiple personalities.\n",
        "\n",
        "The extras are geared towards kids with the music videos, but the overall presentation of the bluray is wonderful. I love the case! So perfect! I really love it so much. This game is wacky to say the least but it is fun and my girls like to play it. God bless. The TV was perfect for what we were looking for. Great price for great value. Great game for the family. Love Nintendo games. Great for the kids with little to no violence. We got it on sale and we love it. Needed a software update but it didn't take too long. We have both Netflix and Hulu plus so the WiFi apps are great! And with it requiring an HDMI cable the HD picture quality is fabulous! Great product and a great price. God bless. Works like it should, a little sensitive to the K band, went off a lot just passing strip malls,Wal*Marts on the freeway. It's a great season! Any Anna Paquin fans should watch! My first plasma TV and I love it. Great Price for a great TV This was very funny. A great flick about the place that so many people would love to work. Owen and Vince are always a treat! Must see. This tablet was purchased for my wife to use for her work. The ease of us eager portability made this a perfect fit for her purse and for her purposes.  We all have this product and truly believe with all the times it has fallen on the ground it has protected our phones. Just a great cover. Bought for my 10 year old daughter. She loves it. Can cook like mom. I love being able to use this wireless printer and not worrying about whether it will work or not. It works every time! Price performer. Ease to travel with. Plug the receiver into the USB and leave it there. Great buy. This iPad has enough power and functionality to allow me to continue working on projects started on my MacBook Air without losing anything. Apps download fast and books are easy to read. Great product and very happy with my purchase! I am pleased (finally) with the system setup includinf the HD receiver. TV is high quality,, great picture and sound. Will see how it performs ongoing. Great for reading, doesn't take good pictures but I strictly purchased this item for reading. The WIFI is great and you can read, surf the Web and do most anything that you could if this item was a I pad or a computer. I bought this movie for my 9 year old son and he loved it. This holder opens easily and is quite light so it does not impact holding the iPad at all. It also has special ribs that allows you to sit the iPad on your lap or on the table and watch videos. It also is padded enough to provide at least some protection to the iPad if you drop it. Great for beginners. Would love a longer battery life. I bought this microwave to replace our small .9 cuft red microwave when we moved to our new home. It is easy to use, works great, and looks great too being stainless steel. Nothing bad to complain about here. Being able to change the font makes all the difference. I'll be traveling to Europe this fall. It will be great to take the Kindle along. I am still learning how to use it and figuring out what all the features are. So far very pleased with my purchase! I upgraded from a smaller screen to this much larger touchscreen and I absolutely love it. I like Garmin products and this is my 3rd Garmin ( I travel a lot and like to upgrade to the newest technology). I really recommend this larger version and it's easier to see and has nice added features. Lifetime maps! This is a great keyboard . only thing that I didn't like was when I change the brightness to full when plugged in after a while it will default back to a lower level .. its not a big deal I just wish I had control over that function better. overall I think this is a really comfortable visually pleasing keyboard. I needed a key board to set up my laptop with an extra keyboard. This product is doing the job. My kids love Zelda, I played it myself as a child. great movie for kids to watch especially in the car. My husband loves this remote. He had 6 others before and now only one. Exactly what I was looking for to protect my investment. Instantly provides four additional ports for wired access (one port is used to connect to your existing network). Though class 4, not very slow..Does its purpose, have had for 5 months now in my camera. Pictures get written fast no lag. Its very versatile and anticipation of more compatible apps to look forward to google android ftw We've had the refrigerator for a couple months, so far it works great.\n",
        "We love how it looks and smudges wipe off the stainless steel surface easily. I have been using the Epson Workforce 610 for years now and love it! This is not my first Epson, and won't be my last. Excellent print quality...the ink cartridges are very good quality, and you get a lot of prints for the money! it's sound like old school linkin park I love it.\n",
        "The Hunting Party packs a punch that has not been felt in a very long time with it's raw sounding \"garage-band-basement\" guitar riffs, refreshing and catchy lyrics and head smashing drums which brings back memories of the late 90's. my two son 6 and 8 loved this movie can't get enough of This is still a good solid ereader. The screen is clear, has little to no glare. The device is lightweight and the font size can be adjusted.\n",
        "\n",
        "I purchased it as a gift for my mom and she loves it. Nice port to the Xbox 360. I enjoyed having the Lost Chapters material included. well this war movie is a good war movie to watch on a rainy day or a saturday after noon if you have 4hrs spare it has a good back story and when the battle starts between the north and south it is amazing and the sound on home theater is good so if you want to see a good war movie about the north and south i would check it out yes it is a little long but it is worth seeing so check it out like it\n",
        "very easy and simple to use and easy to clean I really like the action and the characters in the movie They're priced competitively. Who doesn't need batteries? They were on sale and I needed some, that's the gist of it. good microwave\n",
        "small\n",
        "not very powerful\n",
        "fan is not great Works well using it for work I can tell who is calling I can see missed calls and anyone texting. this is my first smart phone and I love it! easy to use and fun! Keeps me organized and has a long battery life. Seems to me my friends with iphones are constantly walking around with their charger whining about needing to charge their phone. My phone holds a charge all day! LOVE IT! Great show wish the only bad this is that there was only ten episodes and they are stopping at the seven season they better not leave you hanging at the end . I really love the show This movie is very intense. From beginning to end. What we liked most about it was that there were real service men in the movie. Two thumbs up. Love this cd! The music reminds me of seeing the broadway show. Buy this cd if you love the broadway show. This is an antenna. That's pretty much it. It works and you should but it if you need one. I upgraded to flip phone and now realize why everyone is enamored with the IPhone. It is easy to learn how to use ,give good instructions and is very reliable. This is a very nice adaptor and it is a very good size Great 16G memory card that can holds lots of your photo memories or use it to store documents or whatever else you like. Great for video games as well. Perfect for a small room or child's room. Picture is small of course but good. Very simple to set-up and operate. Since we're all bound to the inevitable \"upgrades\", and since I keep receiving files that only work with Office 2007 or later, I felt it was time to upgrade....but I didn't want the online subscription-thing, and I certainly didn't need the entire Office suite. Since I primarily work with Word and Excel for business and personal uses, choosing the \"Office Home &amp; Student 2013\" upgrade seemed to be my best option.\n",
        "It DOES take some getting used to. Most of all the classic buttons and things to click on are all in their common places, it's just that those common places are a bit more fancy than they were before. Still, I'm pleased that I upgraded, it's just going to take some time to get used to everything. This is an excellent tv combo for gamer or traveler. works really well in RV and the DVD feature is great 2for1 space saver Good battery life and descent sound. No problem syncing with iPad and phone. Radio is a bonus. decent looks\n",
        "less storage than our older LG fridge I love this game, it's easy to play and a lot of fun. I'm not a huge gamer so it took me a couple tries to get the hang of it, now I can't put it down. I used it for saves for my Xbox 360 and it works perfectly. I bought this wiimote to be able to play four players on Mariokart 8, and it looks awesome. The different colors on the buttons help to identify them more easily. Had issues with Apple TV connectivity. Plugged in and no issues from the start. If you're an Andrea Bocelli fan you will love this cd. great smooth sounding music. This is really a great value. You get a good solid mac mini for a good price. Great in size and what you can do with it. I have two and wanting to get a third one. The headphones are very useful for me.I listen to them at work everyday. I got it during the last black Friday for $199(aftet $100 GC). I have had multiple tablets including Nook, Samsung etc, nothing stands near the IPAD. Highly recommended. Only constraint is the limited storage. This is a Very good cable very nice fit and finish This is not my first Otterbox case. I dropped my first smart phone within 1 week of getting it and shattered the screen (didn't buy a case). Since then I've always bought an Otterbox case for every phone. I've dropped my phone several times and there's not one scratch! Definitely worth the money! So much sound from such a small speaker. My son loves it and so do I. This is a great flash for my small camera. The pictures look so much better! This wifi-ready dvd player added Netflix and dvd capability to a new flat screen TV without having to get a roku box. Great product, streams all my itunes purchases, much better than the ruko, I have 5 of them, and I am switching them all out for I-TVs Great monitor , I bought 3 for a triple monitor nvidia surround works great, had to config all monitors color setting to equalize color levels between monitors. other than that they seem very stable and great colors for the size and price you cant beat it. Fits ipad well, and it will protect ipad. Daughter loves color. Good selection for a college student. Touch screen is a plus! You can switch SIM card type if you ever change phones. In the rush to clean their vaults, record companies often scrape the bottom of the barrel, releasing music that should have never seen the light of day. Fortunately, \"Johnny Cash at Madison Square Garden\" is just the opposite. Why this AMAZING RECORDING languished unheard for 33 year may just as much a mystery as the whereabouts of Amelia Earhart. With the help of Carl Perkins, The Statler Brothers and The Carter Family, Cash transforms the cavernous arena into an intimate country hoedown. Recorded in 1969, at the height of his powers, this is a must own for any fan of The Man In Black Used with point and shoot digital camera to take photos and video underwater. Works great so far. Sale price was excellent. The kids just love this movie, and the 3D effects are pretty neat. It is amazing how the movie is made of Legos. A ton of time must have been spent making this movie. Some jokes are directed towards adults, but the entire movie can be viewed by the entire family.\n",
        "The ending is worth the wait. Took this to my kidney doctor and he said it was very accurate. It's convenient and it keeps great records love this product! it's stylish and functional. I like how light they are. They seem durable, too. Pretty good product, serves its purpose and gets the job done. It takes some getting used to but I like it. It's wonderful for proofing very sturdy, not bulky, nice fit, very durable especially with an 18month old always grabbing it. Easy to use and lasts an acceptable amount of time I love these two together. Not as funny as Wedding Crashers by good flick. Great movie for kids they loved it, I even enjoyed the movie ending was surprising Works great and charges the phone quickly. If you need a second USB port look else where well what can i say about underworld it is amazing from start to finish and it has the best sound for home theater bc it rocks from start to finish and it has good acting through out the whole film so if you want to see an amazing vampire / wear wolf than this the one to watch so check it out Kids loved it and so did my hubby. He has been waiting for a Lego movie since was a kid. Sound bar is great for a decent size living room. Quality is good for a small house hold if you don't need anything over the top. Then again for its price it is a good system. Great movie for the family. My kids won't stop watching it. I have used this product for years enough said. It's great I bought the stand to hold my small screen when I do karaoke at retirement centers in the area. I like the fact that it is compact and it suits my needs. Being able to finally utilize On Demand is a nice plus to all of the other Roamio features.. It also has a fairly decent app for streaming shows to devices and it's ability to record 6 shows means no more scheduling conflicts. Similar to other DVRs it can beam shows to other Tivo's, in the home. The worst part is dealing with Comcast to get a cable card working so you can access premium channels and On Demand. I bought two of these for my shop they are networked to an I5 server in the office, they are not the fastest in the world but seem to be reliable and fast enough to find part numbers and prices, good on the internet and easy to set up. This is my second iPad Smart Cover. I bought one for my first iPad, and needed one for my iPad Air. I love how perfect these cover fit! I bought this phone for my daughter. Her last phone had numerous issues. She is very pleased with this phone. She uses the web a lot and texts like there's no tomorrow. The video is much clearer than her last phone. Epson has always in my opinion made the best quality printers and inks in the business. The yellow one featured here gives you bright color, clean and crisp! it's ink what else can I say. it's always in stock,easy to find. I do like the fact that I can purchase a double pack instead of two single packs of ink. Overall this is a good product. The only problem is the camera shutter sound cant be silenced. I bought this for my salon, and I love it! I'm using it all day long, it holds my iPad at the perfect height from my desk, and my clients think its cool! Only go Apple for your optical drive on your Mac. Others say they are compatible but beware. It's worth the money I haven't played the previous games of this installment and I had no problem getting into the gameplay and story. The graphics look awesome and the game runs smooth. I played as a hero first; now I'm playing as a villain and the change in gameplay it's awesome. Excellent tablet case. Nice that it protects the tablet and also looks good. I have purchased several IPods in the past. I purchased this IPod for it's bluetooth feature. Yes, the bluetooth feature does tend to use up the battery. The solution for me was that I happened to also purchase a Wireless Bluetooth FM Transmitter Radio Adapter that plugs into my car outlet. The device allows me to hear the music wireless or by connecting the Ipod's cable into the adapter's USP port. I also purchased the case protector with the belt clip, it makes it super easy to handle when I'm driving. I recommend the accessories if you chose to use it while driving. My kids love this game. Not sure why, but they do. Seems very interesting. The only issue I have there should not have been a activation fee. I was not informed there was one. I believe if I would have gone to a sprint store I wouldn't have had to pay the fee. I've been a customer for years. Small enough to fit in any knapsack. Great sound and last long enough for hours of music enjoyment. Should recommend.  Works well protecting the screen of my smart watch The sound on these is not as great as everyone says , but is still pretty good. I love that they are wireless and very easy to setup and use. Hands free!! Id's are big Disney fans. They are familiar with most characters and enjoy this game and all the familiarity it brings. I am not too familiar with the game play, but my kids age 5 - 10 really enjoy it and have played hours with it. Bought this printer for my work-at-home business. Print jobs and scans are very good quality. Even printed out some iron-ons for t-shirts for my daughter and they are clear and clean (no ink smudges). Very impressed with this little printer. I think it was a good choice just dont like the fact that it picks up a lot of background noise Great for children and beginner's! Definitely worth the price! My mophie has been on the road with me to concerts, fairs, all over &amp; I never have to worry about my cell dying. I can charge 2 devices at once. Charges quickly! I'm so glad I ordered this- definitely a life saver. I never leave home without it! I bought this computer for school and I love it! Absolutely perfect! Not much to say, other then these cables do exactly what they are supposed to do. They have a nice snug fit into the socket, and were easy to twist-tie the excess cable. When my grandson comes over his uncles don't like to share their controllers so instead of tears I just went out and easily bought this. It's locked up by cash registers so glad I asked the attendant by the door cause I was in and out of store in 10 minutes and Not a tear has been shed since! What do I say about batteries.. Energizers are my favorite and worked well for me. I got it because of brand name, capacity and price We purchased player for bedroom, so for that its perfect. Already have a smart tv so we didn't need extra bells and whistles I needed one of this to store all my backups! It is so easy to handle that I can retrieve my information at any computer. would definitely recommend to others Lenovo all in one has been one of my best computer purchases so far for the price Small speaker but pretty good sound and easily recharges as well as blue tooth. I purchased the Insignia - 6\" Tripod around the same time I purchased the Sunpak - PlatinumPlus Mini-D 11.5\" Tripod. Love'em both! This Microsoft office was very user friendly. I use it often for various reasons. Very good tool to have. Great quality sound quality is excellent fit good with my iPhone overall this is a great quality product It is great for the family &amp; kids to enjoy. Have fun. I use Insignia - 6\" Tripod with my Samsung Galaxy Camera 2. Honestly, this camera is a tad on the big side for this tripod, but it was so inexpensive and I love the adjustable legs. Good sizes fast easy and colors are great and is light Expectations feel a tad bit short on this movie remake. Has a TON of action, scenes, but spent too much time of superman's background and then it seemed rushed towards the end of the move, and mostly filled with high action scenes, perhaps too much action. Great for play or work. Battery is extremley well!! Love the multiple kicksatnd angles and the new screen size. very good computer..could use for anything or anyone! A very cool movie. It gives a little more of Wolverine's backstory. Great Value can be use PC or Mac with password protection and encryption. Nice original controler, in bought it to be able to play FIFA and works just fine Great gadget to add to my collection. I'm happy with my decision to purchase My daughter loves this pokemon game. Good quality. Great laptop. Fun cool settings and applications!! Great portable and compact storage device. Runs very quiet and has enough storage to do just about anything. Would love to see this in a larger capacity!!! I've tried all the wireless headphones and this has been the best out of all of them! I needed a smart tv for My kitchen to watch netflix, this one si a perfect size and super quality image No complaints, tv works great!! Happy with my purchase So far, no problem. I need time to check if this is good or not. Due to my recent divorce, my wife claimed our old LG washer (with steam cycle). I liked the LG product so much I replaced it with a washer/dryer set. This product can be used in many ways. I use it most of the time as a hand grip. Bought it to replace the old rechargeable batteries and needed new rechargeables for my Xbox One controllers. Works great and don't need to get the MS single battery pack. This is excellent washing machine, and I'm enjoying now. No tax, free shipping, can't go wrong with that. Plus buying downloadable content is tax free, at least for me. Works great and syncs up with my computer really fast and holds a long battery charge. No problems or complaints to report. The item works great. It is printer ink. It is what it is. I would recommend this product if the price was closer to that of the competition's. I bought this 50\" TV on July and it satisfies me so far. Picture quality and color specter are good, sound is clear. This TV primarily is used for watching regular TV channels and movie streaming from Netflix. I'll recommend it to others. Great headphones and comfortable. Half the price of many others with just as good sound quality. Easy to use and easy to add the points to your Microsoft Store account. it is a great product with a great price. Great spent. Great game online and off. This edition comes with the complete set of online maps (No additional single player content) that are really well designed. Well worth the price, as it comes with ALL the DLC! I would buy it again and recommend it to my friends and family Very surprised that as an adult I enjoyed it as much as my kid I love to review my pictures on this camera - the screen is so large, they really come to life! Must stop throwing my controllers :( but for 30 bucks (on sale) it made life a little easier Great budget printer. Prints from computer or phone, Wolverine, another great Xmen Spin-off. Great acting and great story! A family friendly game from the great LOTR saga. Lego makes it all the better! Recommended for all ages! Expectation are met. Durable. Easy to adjust TV to view at any angle. I also mounted sound bar to unit with separate sound bar mount. It was needed to install new appliances. Extra charge. Easy to setup. I had my movie streaming to my TV in minutes. I have disconnect every so often. Not a big deal. Just hit apple TV and off and it is off and running again. Good movie had the kid movie feel for me but I still thought the story could have been better. The voice action was superb. Always enjoyed Samsung quality of televisions. Feels and seems like you are in the picture, not just watching. Have to use this product for my HP printer. Colors are very good. I really love the sound and quality of this speaker - plus take it anywhere with you! Wanted a TV for my bedroom to watch tv and movies and it's got great picture and sound to meet my needs Use this product for my HP printer. All ink is used up to quickly. This anti-virus program works great. does not take long to set up. always catches anything harmful. I have been using it for 3 years now and it has not had any problems. Works well with little or no signal interruptions. Expanded the signal a lot and can use many more devices without problems Great product. Good quality. I would recommend this product. Strong Great Case with side pocket for cable and good buy Love it I now also bought one for my work and daughter and son Love this new SD card for my camera. So necessary with the increased digital size of each picture file. Allows me to keep up with the volume during travel / design baseline intake info for interior re-design considerations. It's my fist time using Seagate. However it is very easy to use and it works both on Mac and windows. For such a small size it sounds awesome. I use it a lot , easy to carry around and I have no regrets. i use this everyday to listen to conference calls, play music, basically all my audio needs during the day. battery last great and charges quickly Wall mount hold my tv perfectly love it would purchase again It's great for instant pictures. No lag-time waiting to focus or missed shots. I have enjoyed using my laptop at college since my purchase last month Great picture, decent sound. Can't beat it for the price. I love my Gear. It is easy to use and I get a lot of compliments on it. Need to be in the right mood to watch this flick but believe the scenes are realistic You are up and running in no time! It's so much easier to type as opposed to tapping on the screen when I'm in a hurry. Needed to connect the cable TV to the revamped exercise room in an older house. The extra cable was easy to extend with these connectors It lasted as expected but has only been tested for a week Loved it! It was classic Monty Python humor. Full of slap stick comedy, this movie had me rolling on the floor laughing. Perfect, loved the programs and very easy to set up. Provides great sound that spreads around the room. Helped get wifi stronger signal from my office to the front of the house. \"Everything is awesome ;)\" Fun, creative, and entertaining. Easy to set up great for my dad and great volume and portable and easy Bluetooth setup First HP Wireless Printer that I've bought that actually worked out of the box without difficulty setting up. Flawless operation after 2 months now. Although I'm not happy I had to purchase a new iPod, as I had dropped mine and broke it, this iPod has been very easy to use. good tv and picture quality is good. the size is perect for the room. We took this on vacation and it worked perfect. Great value. Great phone..Good answering machine..Easy to set up... The TV purchased (LG 32\") has a very nice image. The clarity is quite remarkable. It was very easy to set up and learn the functions. I would recommend this product to anyone. Really nice lens for a beginner, I am by no means a pro at photo taking. Mostly just family vacations and events but I'm very happy with this lens. Convenient as I purchased the phone from another state for mom's bday. It was for my son in a car with no radio. This was exactly what I needed This dryer is great, specially because it has a steam dryer cycle!! I am not a professional, but I am not a newbie either - I like this lens. Got it as part of a package deal and couldn't be happier. Takes great photos.  perfect length cord for a car charger. Is not fraying like other cords. Nice case hel together well and was easy to work with. The fitbit is an awesome way to compete with friends and family. I love trying to out do my daughters. We were forced to buy a new washer and dryer since our old washer did not work anymore. We found this washer/dryer set and we love it, it really washes clothes very well and fast. It has a great variety of settings and features. I discovered a sale on this charger so decided to purchase multiples; for my office, my girlfriend's place, my home and a spare in the car. These charge my Galaxy s5 quickly and efficiently I bought this card for my lg g3 and thus far am very pleased with the performance. It's very fast and obviously a great way to expand my phone storage. I primarily use the card for pics and music. I highly recommend the card not to mention BB had a great sale on it. Have to have it all the time! Need it to print all the papers I have to do. Couldn't wait to try and it met all my expectations I am satisfied with this product. It's great while listening music n watching movies. The best so far. It's a basic cable. It works. What more can I say about it? Don't mess your equipments output if you didn't select the right audio cable Pixma printers work better than any other I've owned. Ink is expensive but that's the case with all printers. Easy to set up. Needed it to install many programs on my new laptop. Did the job well. Excellent purchase. This phone Exceeds My expectations. So far - doing what it's supposed to be doing. We put it in our guest room - along with coffee and tea pots. The guests love the amenities. I used this without the clip. I wanted a nice handle that I could use in the ocean. It worked great. It's toner and it works. I'd like it to print more but there an xl version of the toner. Love my new phone! It is big for my hands with a case on it...but I love the big screen. The dead zones I used to get with my old phone seem to be better with this phone :-) The case is very well built, it protects my phone very well and the extended battery life is amazing!! Good product for the money. No complaints. I used it in my camera. I was disappointed that your staff did not tell me that it is recommended to have a 4\" clearance all around the sides of the t.v. Quality 3d glasses. Helpful sale personnel.\n",
        "Will definitely recommend to friends This ink is a bit expensive, but it prints great work. I would suggest going to the bigger size since this size needs replacement every month. The BOSE has fantastic sound. VERY easy to set up! I had little room for the sound bar, the salesman advised me to get that mount, it was a magic solution Use my beats for the gym. This cord fit perfectly. Nice tablet for the price! All the samung products are great! Nice Graphics! I've owned several ipods over the years and love them but they do cost a lot more just to get the compatibility with iTunes. Loved the first one and now I love the second movie!!! The 564 ink cartridges are easy to install and the XL versions last longer. This is my first HD televise and it has not disappointed me. I really like how easy the keys are to type on. It is a great size. Kids liked it, at least as much as the first movie. Not bad. I liked the first one better. I would rent it fist Perfect laptop replacement for me. Small form but easily viewable screen. Runs everything I put on it from word, excel to autocad. I love this thing. Put just about anything on your tv! What more can you ask for!? I truly had a wonderful sales person who was patient with me because I was indecisive. I made a good choice. it is a nice piece, light in weight, god specs, easy to install All around good product does exactly what we needed it for. we had the grand kids over and they have enjoyed it several times ... I recommend this device to anyone wife loves using it. Awesome time with it. I love this game! It was one of the best purchases I have made! It doesn't take up much counter space and heats the leftovers or frozen vegetables, what more do you need. Easy to install and use. All that was needed was to pull out of the box, plug and play. I purchased a Samsung water filter for my Samsung refrigerator . Good quality , good price, and easy to install! This cd is the greatest one I have and the first one I listen to every morning, I would highly recommend this cd to anybody who has lost a loved one. The words to the songs are so moving and the blue grass songs are dynamite. If you don't have the right cable you will mess up the what you expect from your HD devices Bluetooth headset comes in handy when you're on the go. very good superhero to add to my collect and I am a very big spiderman fan Great unit for the price as lost original RCA TV remote during move. This remote was easy to connect and controlled both the TV and DVD built into the TV. Great purchase! My 5 year old loved the movies! Really enjoyed watching them. Great quality as well! It is perfect for home office use to get rid of. Receipts, paid bills and unnecessary documents. Loved the price for a great family movie we all enjoyed! We needed a new router and this is as easy as it gets to set it up. I don't think it's any faster than the previous router which was a Linkys. I'm not sure if I'd recommend it to friends or not, but they don't give you an option. Cute movie for all ages. Really enjoyed watching it. The best screen protection...won't use anything else! Great prints &amp; fast! I especially like that this printer has precise paper handling abilities. This printer is also very stylish and very good lookiing. This USB flash drive has worked well for me. Good price for the amount of storage. It's simply amazing what those individuals went through. The book was great; to see the movie was just incredible. How well the actors brought those men \"back to life\". The action was great too. The air conditioner keeps the small bedroom cool all day. I really like this computer. It's fast, reliable, nice color and crispness. Now just need to learn Win 8 but that's Microsoft Got this to use with my hdtv and I am very satisfied with its performance Nice mouse. I use it at work with my laptop. Small enough to drop in my pocket when going from meeting to meeting. Plus it's decorative and I've even gotten compliments on it. This thermal paste works as advertised no prob low heat This router is awesome!!! I lose signal about a block away from my house Easy to use. Haven't had any problems programming. This cable works as expected and is a great length. I also like the thickness of the cable. Perfect size for small locations. It also charges the phone fast. Decent price, good quality. The display quality is excellent, the touchscreen is easy to use and very responsive. Always liked WD products and this drive is USB3 compatible making it run even faster. Even though this is one of his older cd's, I found the music to be very good. The sound of the headset is clear. It sounds like you're in the room with the people you're playing with. Very nice metal lunchbox, just like they used to be made back in the day when my parents had these lunch boxes! Really good music and enjoyed the special effects in 3D. The actors and actresses did a great job. Awesome second movie to Rio, first one was funny and the second one was too! Great family movies! Love this product. We no longer fight over who gets to charge their phone in the car now that we have this 2 port charger. I was pleased with the ease of installation and the performance of the Netgear wireless network extender. It is functioning as I hoped it would and has extended my network into previously \"dead\" areas. This is a powerful system - space saver, too!! My mom loves it. Easy to use receiver. Can play my iPhone over anything that has a imput. I have large hands and this mouse is comfortable for me to use all day. This is good size tablet for everybody. Screen quality is really good. Very portable. A wonderfully told historical story! Enjoyed by several generations in our family. Great movie for families with teens! The price was very good for the size and was easy setup I got the Eureka vacuum because I haven't had a problem with this brand before I recommend you get one. Easy to install and great price. Other stores had the same product priced at about 5-10 dollars more. He sings great songs that seem to come from the heart and makes a girls heart just melt. This is the second unit we have purchased. Bunn has just sunk so low and this coffee maker brews a wonderful cup . I've really enjoyed the Bose headphones. They have great sound and very good noise suppression. I always get the best movies &amp; prices from the best place. Works great and looks nice. I also bought one from monoprice of the same quality at a quarter of the price. This is a great printer for the price. Easy to setup on the network. Can also print to it using your smartphone.

The dishwasher sounds great but was delivered so late not installed yet! Not bad. Has a weird pop on the bass speaker sometimes. This series wasn't as exciting as La Femme Nikita, but is was good. Sorry to see it end. It's a big enough screen, but not to big for my desk. Great picture. Love it and the quality. When I was a kid this was my favorite show. There was always comedy, drama, a little mystery and great entertainment. Still love it as much now as I did then! I've had a lot of cases for my iPad and this one was the best!

        "We use it every day All of our PCs at home are using SSDs, but I have an old laptop that I use for a server. Wanted a cheap internal drive and this was a great choice. Not as fast as a SSD, but pretty reliable so far, for a WD drive (most only last a year for me). i've tried several earbuds that I use only when working out; these have lasted longer than any others Great product and couldn't have asked for anything better for the price! I'm going to get the surround sound system next! If I can set up and use this phone anyone can...I would recommend it. Not a techie person. Very ease to use. great zoom and clarity. I purchased this camera the day before I left on vacation and had no time to try it out. No problem. Very easy to use and great pictures and video. I would not purchase any other cover. I recommend letting the experts install the screen cover. Power usage is on a downscale and super fast defrost. Easy access for cleaning and fits properly on the counter. Love the stainless bod! I have used various PNY memory products over many years (around 20, I reckon). I have never had any problem with this brand. This SDHC card is no exception. Cord works fine with no problems and works as expected. Great movie, would watch again and again who dosnt like planet of the apes? I loved this dvd; it highlights great games throughout the years. If you love all things yankees, you'll love this dvd. I've tried other types of ink and always come back to the original. I thought the product was good for the price.

It's fun and upbeat and good for all ages. Great price for quality. Especially good in multi - floored dwellings. I have brought three, for myself and family members.

Not too loud for my son. it is one of dc comics movie boxed sets ever created This adapter works with several different computer accessories which gave us total access.

        "The price may be considered steep...but with the Linksys name , I was willing to overlook the price for,the reputation. Printer was quick to set up and prints great. Would highly recommend Great bag for my camera and the supplies, extra battery, charger and built to protect the camera. Great price. Incredible washer. Uses a fraction of the water and power of my old 8 year old Kenmore unit. Kenmore struggled with some tougher stains, this LG just cleans everything. Lots of features and options. Absolutely great product. I can play video games and hear everything clearly! Currently this camera allows voice controls, facial recognition for log in, game streaming through Playroom and motion gaming for a fraction of the \"Kinect cost\". Once \"project morpheus\" drops this camera's functionality will increase exponentially. If you love your PS4 GET IT!!! In very satisfied in my purchase it help me a lot. This is a good charger.

I love my music so putting outdoor speakers on the patio is a great way to listen to my music when I am outdoors. This tablet is amazing....especially for the price. The Tegra K1 SoC is a beast. The screen is good, not Galaxy Tab S good....but definitely good enough. Kit Kat runs smooth. It's very vanilla. Nvidia also throws in Trine 2(a Tegra exclusive) as a bonus. Where things get amazing is when you pair it to the Official Nvidia Shield Wi-Fi Direct Controller. I bought 2 of them. The Shield has a mirror mode or screen only console mode through HDMI. All in All this is definitely a great buy. Durable and a perfect fit for my laptop. Awesome color Went from watching a hour glass to lightning fast! The phone stays like new even after it has been dropped many times. I chose the yellow because of the price but it is bright so easy to find in my purse! This mouse is awesome. It fits the hand very well and connects and responds very quickly. Camera is the best! Screen can be a little touchy at times but overall this is a great phone! GOOD VALUE FOR THE PRICE..

Met our needs for a DVD plAyer. Easy to use! Wifi was a must. Needed something for a kids bedroom. It was easy to install and created a huge performance boost on my 5 year old MacBook Pro. I don't know why I would need to get a new Mac! the apps are great for children but the cable too bad. I great movie to watch with your children or grandchildren. Does the job I need it to. Works and for a good price. Had plenty of space for pictures at our family reunion. Helpful kit for protecting tablet and easy to use! This is great cable.

        "Easy to roll up take take with me, wherever I go! Great replacement or addition to my Apple cord. Ordered to replace my last controller which was a little worn out. This is almost exactly like the old W510, except a faster quad CPU. It lacks a gyro, and several other niceities that the W510 had. Great form factor, and solid construction. This movie looks so much better than what I remember! The blu ray was definitely worth the buy to add to our growing Disney Classic DVD collection! Tarzan is always a great movie to watch at any time of the day. This is even better than the first! Minions are more enjoyable than ever and the storyline is spectacular!

It decreased the need to replace my charger cords because it reduces tension on the\"plugs\" Can access content on an iPod, iPad or iPhone, Mac, or PC This is a really good buy and it has a cool look to it. I recommend it if you're into home entertainment swag. I remember watching Hercules as a kid and this just makes watching it over again so much better! The blu ray looks very nice on my LED tv and the extras are fun to enjoy as well. A must have for your movie collection. Very entertaining and getting it on sale was the best part. A few quirky issues related to the trays, but overall very nice printer. I purchased this for my Cab apps to take to my customers. I has worked great. This tripod works great anywhere you go and offers multiple options. Also at a reasonable price. Exactly what I expected from HP. Good instructions, easy to install and nice software. Just what was needed to upgrade an HP refurbished machine from a basic DVD/CD to an all format burner. Got 2 pair on clearance for my niece and I. Good sound quality and like the color. If you're looking for some inexpensive earbuds, then check these out. Can access content on an iPod, iPad or iPhone, Mac, or PC. Works great thus far! Trying to perfect my own recipes. Long lasting and convenient. Also, the price is better than many others. I was getting errors on my old hard drive. No errors now. I got this item when it was on sale.

        "Highly recommended The Time Machine hasn't looked this good since I first saw it at a Saturday matinee in the Sixties. Good enough that the seams in the visual effects of this low-budget production show even more than on the DVD. Still very enjoyable, though. My Kindle is my new best friend! It fits easily in my purse and I'm always downloading books and games to it! One of my best purchases ever! This is such a relaxing game it's very easy to pick up whenever you want to and pick up where you left off. It's fun seeing the old Disney characters and getting to interact with them. It works. Nice resolution. Doesn't last long. Expensive to replace. These batteries were for my 3d glasses and I have watched 5 movies and there still going strong The back light is much superior to the regular Kindle Great protection on all my devises\n",

Less than half the price of an OEM option. love love this show! was at a really good price! definitely worth it The movie was good but not great. The special effects were fantastic. It does what it is designed to do so that I can use my external monitor. A film that's not for everyone. But, I encourage you to view this with an open mind. Visually stunning, thought-provoking and unique little gem. Definitely one of my top films! Works great...no problems...picture quality is awesome. Not to fast, but I knew that when I bought it. Overall, it's worth the price. We used it at the beach during our family reunion. The sound and quality was excellent under the shelter. The movie was good but not great. The special effects were fantastic. This air conditioner works really well. I like that it is quite when it is on. Took it on a recent road trip, works well, for the most part it is up to date. Road construction everywhere. I love the different cooking cycles and the steam clean cycle works great. Great to take on a trip because you can get so many pix on one memory card. Only need 1 or 2 for an entire trip! Good value TV for student with good picture for the price This is the best fan I have ever purchased in my life. Perfect case. A little pricey, but definitely worth it. No problem with Kindle moving around in it at all -- it fits like a glove. Like the way it turns the Kindle on and off when you open and close the cover. Got it free with the purchase of my laptop. Easy to install and have had no problems so far. I've installed on my desktop, laptop and Android phone without problems or slow down. No problems with it so far. So far it is doing very well we are enjoying the color, sound and quickness It was a present for my daughter and she loves it. This is the best printer I ever have purchased in my life. the best charger have ever used and the price was the best I enjoy this camera so much, easy to use, takes great pictures and easy to download to computer. Ok for the price. It's used as an extra one, so it works ok. Bought the phone as a replacement. Is nice and fast. Screen is a bit too large for my taste, but if you want a speedy phone, you need to go big. The batteries have a long life, allowing us to take alot of pictures. The price for the pack was a good value. Works awesome in my house. Carries a good signal through my home , very good product enjoy having this in my presence We loved the dvd player and such a great price too. Great printer with good print quality. Not as high quality as professional prints, but good nonetheless. Works wirelessly with iPad and some computers. Pleased with it thus far. this is my second pair. i had the other ones for 5 years and i accidentally broke them in half. i was happy to see that they still carry the exact same brand. i also purchased a pair for my son and he really likes them.

This is the first GPS I've had, So I can't compare it with anything. But to me, it's great! Easy to use. Good value. It had quick times for offloading pictures. Reliable. This movie keeps you on your toes and throw curves when you're not expecting them. I thought the movie was great and I am glad I got the blue-ray with the UV. Decent price for the quality of the speaker. The holder was a little pricey, but adorable. After installing the program (download or disc), this adapter works great. It's easy, fast and portable. Great for office meetings and presentations at all times. Definately recommend this as a purchase. I use it to recharge batteries for my golf GPS. Like the big screen. Easy to set up. Good sound quality. The movie is a look at what happens when an asteroid crashes into the earth. Fun and scary too. This mouse does what it needs to do for a portable mouse. Works virtually on any surface and fits nicely in the laptop bag. Great for the office and around the house when working remotely. I am a realtor and use this flash for real estate photography. Works great for what I do. Definately recommend this as a purchase. Use for my golf GPS. A must for any Hell Yeah fan. Cd is wonderful and some of their best work. This has solved my frustration of losing internet connection in part of my home. I confidently reach the internet anywhere in my home. We needed this unit desperately when our old ac conked out as our Florida summer temperatures are legendary! We installed the unit quite easily and enjoyed the cool air almost immediately. Ah-h-h! Apple products are terrific but the accessories are expensive. I really like the keypad for the surface pro 3. The holder for the stylus needed some practicing but now the stylus slides in \"like butter\". Good value for price, does what its supposed to do Got this on sale. It works well and have no issues with it. This was an upgrade, but most TVs are compared to our Westinghouse. We are happy! This movie was better than the first.I would recommend for any family with small kids. Like the instructional buttons and the LED helps to understand what to do Easy to set up. Works well. Buttons feel firm when pressed. I bought a case for my iphone 4s because the one that I previously had broke. I found this great case at a great price. can be used for games, dlc and more. and considering how every game for xbox one is now digitally released the same day as the physical media it makes carrying a balance in your xbox live account a worth while thing to have, especially on the rare occasion the gift cards are sold at a discount. Great camera made better with wifi attachment, great quality Good to have soda when you want, without going to the store. Fulfilled all of our needs without door sound system It works and did what I needed. Not much else to say. This is a great movie. Loved it in theaters and now I get to watch it at home. This looks great in blu-ray! Holds over four thousand pictures and hundreds of videos (depending on the length of the video) Purchased the LG washer and dryer because of the CR ratings. So far so good and like the two-sided copy option and easy scanning. It was a fun movie to watch with teenagers. It even surprised me. Great for connecting my apple devices to my audiophile equipment. 4.99 for an HDMI caple this quality is awesome. I bought the last two cables work as advertised. Love the way it fits the shape of the hand. Nice that it comes in different colors as well. Upgraded from an S3. I couldn't be happier. Great phone with great features. Get it, you won't be sorry. My son spends hrs. playing, we have no complaints. This case can also be used for a GPS when traveling. This was a good value for the four movies in a box set I bought this wireless bluetooth for daily use and I love it. Battery last up until two days. Solid in every way. Zero issues and very lightweight everything a iphone should be Good price, easy to setup and has a great sound as well. its ok for storage of large media files I use for my gps maps. This a must have CD for every rise against fan. It is some of their best work. The Bose SIE2i are great headphones for your workout. The sound quality is the best and I haven't had any issues with the control when sweating. These are my first Beat headsets and they sound great but are exspensive. As nice or even better, then the noise canceling headphones ! This does a good job cleaning. It heats up pretty quickly also. The dispenser is a little tuff to get out. It is a great game to buy for your child if they liked the Lego Movie. Bought this to replace the last Bullett. For the money, this blender a steal. Great product. Excellent use for video and pictures Love the blu-ray DBZ. This is a must own for any fan. easy to use phones with lots of features, great price The ink prints clearly and never smudges. I also highly recommend the printer. i was looking at the mac books for sometime .\n",
        "i asked a lot of questions and decided to get the mac air.\n",
        "very please with my choice It is a very workable sound bar that fits perfectly with a table mounted Sony television. Its more expensive then some comporable sound bars but not prohibitively so. the movie as a whole was very entertaining for all to see..will be looking for a sequel or prequel. A VERY NICE SELECTION OF SONGS THAT REALLY HIGHLIGHT LEELA'S VOICE. Very well done series. Historically accurate as well as entertaining. Just the right size for mantle. Couldn't beat the price for a Smart TV and has a great picture. Needed a printer for basic printing and this one worked great! Had the shield put on at purchase. I had the same shield put on my first HTC phone &amp; after 2 years not a scratch or any damage no complaints. This movie is great for kids and adults alike. The acting isn't exceptional, but it's fun. Simplicity, in simple terms, is a great album for fans of rock and all around good music. the story very entertaining and different than other disney movies, great for the whole family. Smart technology with WiFi. Haven't used 3D feature yet. Standard speakers only negative. Purchased a Sony sound bar that works very well. it is very good protector, but I think is a bit heavy, it is good stuff\n",
        "is a good price, and there in various colors Great for backing up a laptop, especially before a factory reset. Works as advertised. Great picture looks amazing!!! Couldn't be more happy Perfect for intended purpose, easy set up, great picture Apple notebook like no other much better than a regular pc it has all the features you need easy to use lightweight and more Cables work as expected. These were on sale with a one day special I couldn't refuse. We bought this item as a more economical version of the top brand as suggested by the sell. Great buy!!! Love the blu-ray DBZ. This is a must own for any fan. A five year old could use this. Unreal how simple and fast this was. Terrific sound. You have to try all the ear pieces to find the optimal size for comfort. Was on the market for some printer paper and this kind was a good value and a great price! Great ink, what else can I say? :-) I've always used HP Ink and Printers for years and have had little to no issues with them. Love the noise cancellation and that it can fold up small to fit into backpack. Overall, this was a solid film. The 3D was nothing special, but there were moments where it shined. We love our Hulu membership. It's affordable ,we can watch all our favorite shows, and it's a great alternative to cable. Great purchase! Classic! Definitely one of the best mob movies out there. Helps my son get through a long trip out of town with unlimited battery life. As a metal head in search of more things heavy and loud, this is a great find. Gamma Ray is a phenomenal band much like their predecessor Helloween. This is a great product. Very fast response even with my older computers. Operates several devices at one time with no delays. My old iPad cable broke after about a year. Bought a new one and use it for my iPad and iPhone. i was looking for an inexpensive phone for home. The price was right and the item is just what I needed. Pages of instructions, who works for NASA? I gave up. I love having the smart hub. I don't have to hook anything up to my tv to access netflix. 3D movies are really cool on this tv. I also like being able to access other apps on here. These headphones are expensive, but worth it for the quality. I don't even watch regular cable anymore, at all!! Titanic looks even more fabulous in blu ray. Liked the extras as well. If you like the movie, you should own it in blu ray. Big fan off the series. I really enjoyed this one and am currently playing First Light dlc. Do yourself a favor and experience next gen gameplay and visuals wih this. Great movie faith popcorn. Lots of action and good plot I had the same case for HTC one . I was happy with case but not the phone.  A good game with a great story. I bought used based on principle but I was very happy with my purchase Previously had a MacBook Pro for 8 years. Needed a desktop and went with the IMac. Couldn't be happier. Definitely worth the price! This device was fairly easy to step up. I have no complaints about the device and has been working great since I got it. Easy to install less than 30 minutes looks outstanding. This sub is for true music lovers. It is deep and rich. This is coming from a serious audiophile. Although my Sonos system is my secondary one, I find it just as satisfying to audition as my primary that was considerably more expensive. Great addition to the collection of characters for DI. this is one of the nicest wall mount units I've used. The directions are excellent and make set up a breeze Purchased this for my son and he loves it. He is actually learning more how to read because of it Spent so many hours playing and doing all the tasks. Pretty good I had to buy this because my auto charger for phone stopped charging. Works great and I can charge other devices with this as well. Exactly what was advertised for a great price and extremely easy to install with all the extras that come with it Good product to keep cords organized at a good price point. Good overall action flick, sets up sequels, Easy to want to watch again. Great item, great price and multiple power connections is great for all of the different computers that I have. My 3yrs old loves this movie, highly recommed it for a family movie night Got great help. They all worked with me to get me. I love this product. it works right. it's feels good in the hands &amp; it's solid I love this product. it works right. it's feels good in the hands &amp; it's solid Happy with my blu ray player great picture works well with my smart tv Good value for Bluetooth and satellite radio. Still learning features but we are satisfied. Usually im not anhuge fan of sequals but this one was definitely a good one! We have had many lighting storms in the area and hooked to may computers and no damage. Much, much nicer case than I was able to purchase at the Verizon store. This movie is definantly a must watch it will keep you at the edge of your seat from the beginning. It's a combination of everything that makes me love them Good action flick, plot easy to follow. References to early movies involving the main charactors. It isn't historically accurate, but it is based on a graphic novel. This movie is action-packed, and a very good story. sccreen size is great andso easy to use. need more apps. Overall good quality headphones and service as always Works great easy installation great product for the price See \"what's great about it\" above. I have a Canon S100 and this case holds it and 2 additional batteries. they are soft and don't hurt your ears no matter how long they are on love this movie, was sad to hear of his death. glad that I was able to get this at a good price Great buy. Perfect size, picture quality perfect. Setup simple. Love watching Netflix, Youtube. Pandora sounds great love how it seems like abig computer but is so small and easy to use I am happy with my chose because it thin and good Colo contrast The ink always seems to last longer than expected. Worked great for invitations the wife printed. Picked up this for under 5 bucks. What a steal. I love watching older movies from when I was younger. Showing them to my kids. I find it more enjoyable then most of the garbage they put out today. Love all batman movies but the joker is my fav awesome I great replacement for a broken cord we had. Also great for a backup. Very good product for cleaning computer screens and your television. Bought an Apple because it's not easily hacked and has a good reputation hilarious, good price on the movie. one of my favorites Got it on sale. Worth a purchase but limited on games it works with so don't expect all games to work. Also, the pivot app you need to download messes with my wifi on my s5 On my wall in the bedroom! Great picture, price, color &amp; sound for the price! i get good deal for my business, also very EASY to installed Really nice set of t!ts. They jiggle when the bass hits. Love the plot its keep me wanting more and buy other series My brothers and I used to pretend we were the three of them. Each played a roll and now I get to share it with my children who just started getting into action movies and karate movies. Always great reliving a classic you grew up on with your kids. The ink always seems to last a little longer than expected when printing lots of color pages. The quality of the Canon printer/ink has been great! good price for 2 dvds, stupid humor that my boyfriend enjoys I don't think there are any bad Transformer movies, in my opinion. I like all of them and this one is no exception. Love it. Works exactly how advertised. Use it often to stream all my movies and TV shows Really not a bad watch at all. Loses some of the luster the original had, but overall a fun movie. Maybe even get someone interested in the real history of the what the movie is based off of. This laptop is great for a new Mac user. Love it, I'd recommend it Purchased a second on for our second nexus. Still the only thing its missing is a closure system. Other than that its a great product. Bought this for my little cousin and ended up keeping it for myself! It's a great family movie and it's just as good as the first one. I got this for my 9 and 7 year old kids! We love them! They do the job and they're easy to print or write on. This is the 2nd Passport I have bought. Like it very much. I love this vacuum it is very light and very good. If you use it for a long time it does get real hot. Excellent product, it met my requirements, I highly recommend it Great little case, I was worried the white case would get dirty easy but not the case and is very easy to clean. Good protection easy to use. Great sub. Kinda pricey compared to other subs of the likes but sounds great. No complaints from me. No issues,whatsoever,with this item.Brother product is \"Spot On\",as always. Bought for my granddaughter, she was well pleased. Nice product. However, sometimes can take a while to boot up. And the 'a' key is frustrating. Great pair of headphones. I would recommend these headphones. \\Excellent sound, easy to sync, loud, love it\n",

        "} Great TV to setup. Can connect directly to the YouTube app from my cell phone Great dryer great price would recommend to anyone! Overall happy with purchase. Over time case wore out Won't find a better Vaccum just as good as dyson if not better The sound is great. The Bluetooth is awesome and sits well Its very easy to use and not too expensive. Great for anyone. Funn design and color. Very attractive colors especially for small children Great graphics and fun to play, story mode could've lasted a little longer Its a phone case, what else can i say, lol. Besides, it was for my roommate, but he loves it. What a fun filter this is. It creates the most beautiful dreamy images. Very well put together unit, love the wireless aspect, throw in the ability to be used with both PC and PS4 and you have a winner. Can't beat the price and the surround sound is great. Glad I purchased this item Characters interaction makes this an entertaing movie. Overall, an excellent picture with great detail;.Colored lines provide good view. Works well until after it gets used a few times. We really needed another in the house. Great for anyone preferring to watch movies etc. on a large screen. good price; ink does not smear; easy to install; quality product For the small price tag, it was hard to go wrong. Makes solid shakes and smoothies without ending up with a huge thing to wash. Easy to clean, easy to use. Enjoy! good movie if you want to get mad. Not a chic flick Have hours of fun with this! I would surely recomend this to a friend I have had this scale for about two months and it is still going strong. There are still no sighs of wear or have not even had to change the battery. This is by far the best scale. It is accurate and easy to use. Works well, easy to set up. Works great for us, strong signal. Bought this case for half off-superb value. Easy to find in a large purse due to bright colors. Durable and attractive Hoping this works well for my daughter in college! Great computer for the price, does everything it's supposed to do. Windows 8 took a little getting used to. My kids loved this movie as did I. The actors doing the voices of the birds were great! ok low level headset. I use with dragon and no issues. Great camera for the price, easy to use. Good looking product. This remote is simply the best. Very easy to use. Once you learn your way around, only one remote controls all. Very sleek and slim design. If you can program the remote, you can save MONEY! I'm considering buying second remote for my bedroom. I like that fact that I can lessen to my music and I would recommend this to someone looking for a simple to use Bluetooth. I use the platinum cases for all my phones. They are the best I have found. Great phone. Very fast and easy to use. Love the amount of space it has.      \n"
